## Next Steps

1. Focus on converting remaining analytics components to Astro wrappers
2. Complete documentation layout implementation
3. Setup server-side auth checks for improved security
4. Implement API versioning and documentation
5. Add remaining tests for Astro components
6. Investigate root cause of null byte issues for permanent solution
7. Update remaining interactive components to use the Astro wrapper pattern

## Notes

- Keep React components that require heavy interactivity
- Use Astro's partial hydration when possible
- Ensure proper error handling throughout
- Maintain TypeScript strict mode
- Follow HIPAA compliance requirements
- Keep accessibility standards high
- Use build-clean.js for components with null byte issues during build
- Default build command now uses the build-clean.js script for improved reliability

export const components = {
  // Add any custom MDX components here
};

## Layout Conversions
- [x] Sidebar - Created Astro wrapper, preserved React component as SidebarReact.tsx, added client:load for hydration
- [x] Header - Created Astro wrapper, preserved React component as HeaderReact.tsx, added client:load for hydration
- [x] Footer - Converted to pure Astro component (Footer.astro), no client-side interactivity needed
- [x] MainLayout - Created MainLayout.astro with Header, Footer, and ViewTransitions integration
