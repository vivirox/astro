# Therapy Chat System Plan

The therapy chat interface provides AI-based therapy interaction with strict security and compliance measures. Security will exceed HIPAA requirements using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) protocols.

## Core Features

### Client Experience

- Intuitive chat interface
- Mobile-responsive design
- Secure message delivery
- Encrypted storage of sensitive data
- Session state preservation
- Offline capabilities with sync

### Therapist Dashboard

- Session monitoring
- Intervention flags
- Progress tracking
- Encrypted note-taking
- FHE-based session validation
- Secure export of session data

### Security & Compliance

- End-to-end encryption
- Secure authentication
- HIPAA-compliant data handling
- Audit logging
- Fully Homomorphic Encryption implementation
- Secure key management

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Components

- **Chat UI**: React with TailwindCSS
- **State Management**: React Context + Hooks
- **FHE Client**: TFHE-rs/concrete integration
- **Storage**: IndexedDB with encryption
- **Network**: Fetch API with retry/offline support

### Backend Services

- **Authentication**: JWT with FHE extensions
- **Message Processing**: Node.js with streaming
- **Storage**: PostgreSQL with encrypted fields
- **Analytics**: Secure aggregation with FHE

## Implementation Phases

1. **Fully Homomorphic Encryption Authentication**

   - Set up secure key management system
   - Implement session_validator for FHE operations
   - Create session management with secure token storage
   - Verify FHE implementation with security audit

2. **Core Chat Functionality**

   - Implement basic chat UI components
   - Set up message delivery system
   - Create typing indicators and presence awareness
   - Implement basic sentiment analysis
   - Add message persistence with encryption

3. **Therapeutic Features**

   - Implement therapy-specific prompts
   - Add crisis detection algorithms
   - Create intervention system for high-risk cases
   - Implement progress tracking
   - Add secure note system for therapists

4. **Compliance & Production Readiness**
   - Complete audit logging system
   - Implement HIPAA compliance checks
   - Create authentication system with FHE foundations
   - Set up comprehensive test suite
   - Perform security penetration testing

## Technical Specifications

### FHE Implementation

- All sensitive operations performed on encrypted data
- Key partitioning for enhanced security
- Session-based key management
- Threshold encryption for critical operations
- Secure bootstrapping protocol

### Security Measures

- Key rotation every 24 hours
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention
- IP and device fingerprinting
- Anomaly detection in usage patterns
- Comprehensive access logs

### Documentation

- FHE Circuit implementation examples
- Security model documentation
- Compliance checklist
- Deployment procedures
- Ensure all FHE implementations are verified

## Next Steps

1. Set up development environment
2. Implement Fully Homomorphic Encryption system
3. Create base UI components
4. Implement core security services
5. Begin frontend development
