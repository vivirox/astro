# Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) Module

This module provides a production-grade Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) implementation for the therapy chat system using TFHE-rs WebAssembly bindings.

## Overview

Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) allows computation on encrypted data without decrypting it first. This is particularly valuable for therapy chat applications where sensitive client information needs to remain private while still allowing AI models to process the data.

## Features

- **Production-grade encryption** using TFHE-rs, a Rust implementation of TFHE (Fast Fully Homomorphic Encryption over the Torus)
- **WebAssembly integration** for client-side FHE operations
- **Homomorphic Operations**: Perform operations on encrypted data:
  - Sentiment analysis
  - Text categorization 
  - Content summarization
  - Text tokenization
  - Content filtering
- **Privacy-Preserving Analytics**: Process and visualize encrypted data without decryption:
  - Sentiment trends
  - Topic clustering
  - Emotional pattern detection
  - Intervention effectiveness analysis
  - Risk assessment

## Implementation Details

The implementation uses:

- [TFHE-rs](https://github.com/zama-ai/tfhe-rs) via its WebAssembly bindings
- AES-256-GCM for standard encryption modes
- Node.js crypto module for cryptographic operations

## Security Modes

The module supports different encryption modes:

- `NONE`: No encryption
- `STANDARD`: AES-256-GCM encryption
- `HIPAA`: HIPAA-compliant AES-256-GCM encryption with additional safeguards
- `FHE`: Fully Homomorphic Encryption using TFHE-rs

## Usage

### Initialize the FHE Service

```typescript
import { fheService, EncryptionMode } from '@/lib/fhe';

// Initialize with default settings
await fheService.initialize();

// Or with custom settings
await fheService.initialize({
  mode: EncryptionMode.FHE,
  keySize: 2048,
  securityLevel: 'high',
  enableDebug: true
});
```

### Encrypt a Message

```typescript
const plaintext = "Client message with sensitive information";
const encrypted = await fheService.encrypt(plaintext);
```

### Decrypt a Message

```typescript
const decrypted = await fheService.decrypt(encrypted);
console.log(decrypted); // "Client message with sensitive information"
```

### Process Encrypted Data

```typescript
import { FHEOperation } from '@/lib/fhe';

// Analyze sentiment without decryption
const sentimentResult = await fheService.processEncrypted(
  encrypted,
  FHEOperation.SENTIMENT
);

// The result is still encrypted
const sentiment = await fheService.decrypt(sentimentResult);
console.log(sentiment); // "positive", "negative", or "neutral"
```

### Generate Analytics on Encrypted Conversations

```typescript
import { fheAnalytics, AnalyticsType } from '@/lib/fhe/analytics';

// Initialize analytics service
await fheAnalytics.initialize();

// Analyze sentiment trends in encrypted messages
const sentimentTrend = await fheAnalytics.analyzeSentimentTrend(messages);

// Create a full analytics dashboard
const dashboard = await fheAnalytics.createAnalyticsDashboard(messages);
```

### Export Public Key for External Use

```typescript
const publicKey = fheService.exportPublicKey();
// Share this key with external systems that need to encrypt data
// that your system will process homomorphically
```

## Architecture

The FHE module consists of:

1. **FHEService**: Main service class implementing the singleton pattern
2. **EncryptionMode**: Enum of available encryption modes
3. **FHEOperation**: Enum of operations that can be performed on encrypted data
4. **TFHE Context**: Management of cryptographic keys and operations
5. **Types**: Interfaces for requests, responses, and metadata

## Performance Considerations

FHE operations are computationally intensive. Consider the following:

1. Key generation is slow and should be done during initialization
2. Encrypting and decrypting with FHE takes more time than standard encryption
3. Homomorphic operations are slower than plaintext operations
4. For maximum performance, consider using Web Workers for FHE operations

## Security Considerations

While using FHE:

1. Store private keys securely and never expose them
2. Use proper key rotation policies
3. Apply appropriate access controls to FHE operations
4. Monitor for timing attacks and side-channel vulnerabilities
5. Ensure all communication channels are properly secured

## Real-world Application

In the therapy chat context, FHE enables:

1. AI models to analyze encrypted therapy transcripts without seeing the content
2. Detection of concerning patterns without compromising patient privacy
3. Generation of insights while maintaining HIPAA compliance
4. Secure collaboration between different healthcare providers
