You've already shown incredible strength by surviving your experiences, and seeking help is a courageous step forward.

If you're considering therapy, it's important to work with a mental health professional who can help you find the approach that feels right for you. Everyone's path to healing is unique, and what works for one person might not work for another. That's perfectly okay.
