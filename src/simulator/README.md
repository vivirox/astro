# Real-Time Healthcare Simulation Module

This module implements a real-time healthcare simulation environment inspired by the Liftoff project approach. It provides practitioners with a safe, private environment to practice therapeutic interactions without any data recording or persistent storage.

## Key Features

- **Real-time interaction** with simulated patients through browser-based WebRTC
- **Zero data retention** for complete privacy and HIPAA compliance
- **Immediate feedback** on therapeutic approaches and techniques
- **Privacy-preserving metrics** for tracking personal improvement
- **Simulated patient scenarios** based on various therapeutic needs and contexts

## Technical Implementation

This module consists of several key components:

1. **WebRTC Communication Layer**
   - Browser-based real-time audio/video streams
   - Ephemeral stream processing 
   - No recording or persistent storage

2. **Real-time Analysis Engine**
   - Stream-based therapeutic technique detection
   - Privacy-preserving processing pipeline
   - Zero-retention data handling

3. **Feedback Generation System**
   - Immediate, context-aware guidance
   - Healthcare-specific feedback models
   - Stateless processing design

4. **Scenario Management**
   - Configurable patient scenarios
   - Difficulty progression system
   - Training scenario catalog

5. **Anonymous Metrics Collection**
   - Privacy-preserving progress tracking
   - Aggregated learning patterns
   - No personal identifiable information

## Implementation Timeline

This module will be implemented in three phases:

1. **Phase 1: Core Infrastructure** (3 weeks)
   - WebRTC integration and real-time processing
   - Basic feedback generation
   - Privacy-preserving architecture setup

2. **Phase 2: Enhanced Features** (4 weeks)
   - Advanced feedback mechanisms
   - Therapeutic technique detection
   - Patient scenario development

3. **Phase 3: Integration** (3 weeks)
   - Platform integration
   - Anonymous metrics dashboard
   - Performance optimization

## Security and Privacy

This module is designed with privacy and security as core principles:

- No session recording
- No persistent storage of interactions
- Real-time processing only
- HIPAA-compliant throughout
- Anonymized metrics collection only with user consent
