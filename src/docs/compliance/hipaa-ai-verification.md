- [ ] Confirm that high-risk areas have appropriate controls
- [ ] Test effectiveness of risk mitigation measures
- [ ] Verify that residual risks are documented and accepted
- [ ] Confirm that risk management is an ongoing process

## 8. Training and Awareness

### Staff Training
- [ ] Verify that all staff using AI components have received HIPAA training
- [ ] Confirm that training includes AI-specific privacy and security concerns
- [ ] Test staff knowledge of HIPAA requirements for AI usage
