## Deployment Process

Our deployment process is designed to be automated, reliable, and secure. It includes the following key components:

- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing, building, and deployment
- **Environment Management**: Configuration for development, staging, and production
- **Rollback Procedures**: Quick recovery from failed deployments
- **Verification**: Automated checks to ensure successful deployments
- **Monitoring**: Real-time status and performance tracking

## CI/CD Pipeline

Our CI/CD pipeline is implemented using GitHub Actions and is defined in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`. The pipeline consists of the following stages:

1. **Build**: Compile and package the application
2. **Test**: Run unit tests, integration tests, and security scans
3. **Deploy**: Push the application to the target environment
4. **Verify**: Run post-deployment checks
5. **Rollback**: Automatically recover from failed deployments

For detailed information, see [CI/CD Pipeline](./ci-cd.mdx).

## Environments

We maintain the following environments:

- **Development**: Local development environment for engineers
- **Staging**: Pre-production environment for testing and QA
- **Production**: Live environment for end users

Each environment has its own configuration, database, and security settings. For detailed information, see [Environments](./environments.mdx).

## Rollback Procedures

Our system includes comprehensive rollback procedures to quickly recover from failed deployments. These procedures are automated and can be triggered manually or automatically by the CI/CD pipeline.

For detailed information, see [Rollback Procedures](./rollback.mdx).

## Verification

After each deployment, we run a suite of verification checks to ensure the application is functioning correctly. These checks include API endpoint tests, database connectivity tests, and performance tests.

For detailed information, see [Verification Procedures](./verification.mdx).

## Monitoring

We use a combination of monitoring tools to track the health and performance of our application in real-time. These tools include:

- **Health Checks**: Regular checks of critical system components
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of response times and resource usage
- **Error Tracking**: Centralized logging and alerting for errors
- **User Metrics**: Monitoring of user activity and engagement

For detailed information, see [Monitoring](./monitoring.mdx).

## Security

Our deployment process includes several security measures to protect the application and user data:

- **Secrets Management**: Secure storage and access to sensitive data
- **Access Control**: Role-based access to deployment resources
- **Security Scanning**: Automated scanning for vulnerabilities
- **Compliance**: Adherence to regulatory requirements

For detailed information, see [Security](./security.mdx).
