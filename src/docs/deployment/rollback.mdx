# Deployment Rollback Guide

This guide explains the rollback procedures for our Astro application. Proper rollback procedures are essential for minimizing downtime and ensuring service reliability when deployments encounter issues.

## When to Initiate a Rollback

Initiate a rollback in the following situations:

1. **Critical functionality is broken** after a deployment
2. **Performance degradation** is severe and affecting user experience
3. **Security vulnerabilities** are discovered in the new deployment
4. **Data integrity issues** arise from the new code
5. **Compliance requirements** are not met by the new deployment

## Quick Rollback Process

### Prerequisites

- Access to deployment environment
- Application repository access
- Proper environment credentials

### Steps to Execute a Rollback

1. Navigate to the project directory
2. Execute the rollback script:

```bash
./src/scripts/run-rollback.sh
```

This will automatically revert to the last known good deployment.

### Rolling Back to a Specific Deployment

If you need to roll back to a specific deployment ID, use:

```bash
./src/scripts/run-rollback.sh [deployment-id]
```

Where `[deployment-id]` is the identifier of the target deployment.

## What the Rollback Does

The rollback process performs the following actions:

1. **Version Control Reset**: Checks out the previous stable code version
2. **Database Restoration**: Applies any necessary database rollback migrations
3. **Configuration Reset**: Restores previous application configurations
4. **Service Restart**: Safely restarts application services
5. **Notification**: Sends alerts to the team about the rollback
6. **Verification**: Performs basic health checks after rollback

## Verification After Rollback

After executing a rollback, perform these verification steps:

1. **API Health Check**: Verify all critical API endpoints are responding
2. **UI Verification**: Check that the user interface is functioning correctly
3. **Feature Testing**: Test core application features
4. **Performance Check**: Verify performance has returned to expected levels
5. **Log Review**: Check application logs for any errors

## Post-Rollback Actions

After completing a rollback:

1. **Document the Issue**: Record what went wrong in the deployment
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: Determine why the deployment failed
3. **Fix Development**: Create a plan to fix the issues in the failed deployment
4. **Team Communication**: Update the team on status and next steps
5. **User Communication**: If the issue affected users, communicate as appropriate

## Advanced Rollback Options

For more complex rollback scenarios, the script supports additional options:

```bash
pnpm tsx src/scripts/rollback.ts --skip-db --notify=false --verify=true
```

Options include:

- `--skip-db`: Skip database rollback operations
- `--notify=false`: Disable team notifications
- `--verify=true`: Enable extra verification steps
- `--silent`: Run with minimal output
- `--deployment=[id]`: Target a specific deployment
- `--keep-config`: Maintain current configuration files

## Troubleshooting Rollback Issues

If the rollback process itself encounters errors:

1. Check application logs for specific error messages
2. Verify database connectivity and permissions
3. Ensure version control system is accessible
4. Check for locked files or processes
5. Verify environment variables are correctly set

Contact the DevOps team immediately if automatic rollback fails.

## Emergency Manual Procedures

In case the automated rollback fails, follow these manual recovery steps:

1. **Manual Code Reversion**:

   ```bash
   git checkout [last-known-good-commit]
   ```

2. **Manual Database Restoration**:

   ```bash
   pnpm db:restore --backup=[backup-date]
   ```

3. **Service Restart**:

   ```bash
   pnpm restart:services
   ```

## Rollback Testing

The rollback system should be tested regularly:

1. Schedule monthly rollback drills
2. Include rollback testing in deployment validation
3. Practice database restoration procedures
4. Verify notification systems work correctly
5. Time how long rollbacks take to complete

By maintaining and practicing these rollback procedures, we ensure minimal disruption to service when deployment issues occur.
