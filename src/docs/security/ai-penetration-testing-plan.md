# AI Components Penetration Testing Plan

This document outlines the penetration testing plan for our AI components to identify and address security vulnerabilities before they can be exploited in a production environment.

## Objectives

1. Identify security vulnerabilities in AI components
2. Assess the effectiveness of security controls
3. Verify HIPAA compliance from a security perspective
4. Provide recommendations for remediation
5. Document findings and remediation steps

## Scope

### In-Scope Components

1. AI API endpoints
   - `/api/ai/completion`
   - `/api/ai/usage`
   - `/api/ai/admin/*`

2. AI Service Components
   - Authentication and authorization mechanisms
   - Rate limiting implementation
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - Error handling and logging
   - Data encryption and protection

3. AI Admin Dashboard
   - Authentication and access controls
   - CSRF protections
   - XSS vulnerabilities
   - Privilege escalation

### Out-of-Scope Components

1. Underlying infrastructure (AWS, Azure, etc.)
2. Third-party services (TogetherAI API)
3. Physical security
4. Social engineering

## Testing Methodology

### 1. Reconnaissance

- Identify all AI-related endpoints and components
- Map the attack surface
- Identify technologies and frameworks in use
- Review documentation and architecture diagrams

### 2. Vulnerability Scanning

- Perform automated scanning using OWASP ZAP
- Scan for known vulnerabilities in dependencies
- Identify potential security misconfigurations
- Check for sensitive information disclosure

### 3. Manual Testing

#### Authentication and Authorization

- Test for authentication bypass
- Test for authorization bypass
- Test session management
- Test for insecure direct object references
- Test for privilege escalation

#### Input Validation and Sanitization

- Test for SQL injection
- Test for XSS vulnerabilities
- Test for command injection
- Test for insecure deserialization
- Test for template injection

#### Rate Limiting and DoS Protection

- Test rate limiting effectiveness
- Test for DoS vulnerabilities
- Test for race conditions
- Test for resource exhaustion

#### Data Protection

- Test for sensitive data exposure
- Test encryption implementation
- Test for insecure data storage
- Test for data leakage in responses
- Test for insecure data transmission

#### Error Handling and Logging

- Test for information disclosure in error messages
- Test for insufficient logging
- Test for log injection
- Test for log tampering

### 4. Business Logic Testing

- Test for business logic flaws
- Test for insecure workflow
- Test for data validation issues
- Test for race conditions

## Tools

1. OWASP ZAP - Web application vulnerability scanner
2. Burp Suite - Web application security testing
3. Nmap - Network scanning
4. Metasploit - Exploitation framework
5. SQLmap - SQL injection testing
6. Custom scripts for specific tests

## Reporting

The penetration testing report will include:

1. Executive Summary
   - Overview of findings
   - Risk assessment
   - Recommendations

2. Detailed Findings
   - Vulnerability description
   - Severity rating
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Impact assessment
   - Recommendations for remediation

3. Remediation Plan
   - Prioritized list of vulnerabilities
   - Recommended remediation steps
   - Timeline for remediation

## Severity Ratings

Vulnerabilities will be rated according to the following severity levels:

1. **Critical**: Immediate threat to confidentiality, integrity, or availability of sensitive data or systems
2. **High**: Significant risk to confidentiality, integrity, or availability
3. **Medium**: Moderate risk to confidentiality, integrity, or availability
4. **Low**: Minimal risk to confidentiality, integrity, or availability
5. **Informational**: No direct security impact, but could be used in combination with other vulnerabilities

## Testing Schedule

1. **Planning and Preparation**: 1 day
2. **Reconnaissance**: 1 day
3. **Vulnerability Scanning**: 1 day
4. **Manual Testing**: 3 days
5. **Business Logic Testing**: 1 day
6. **Reporting**: 1 day
7. **Remediation Verification**: 2 days

Total duration: 10 days

## Prerequisites

1. Test environment that mirrors production
2. Test accounts with various permission levels
3. Documentation of AI components and architecture
4. Access to source code for review
5. Authorization to perform penetration testing

## Ethical Considerations

1. Testing will only be performed on test environments
2. No actual patient data will be used during testing
3. Testing will be performed during off-hours to minimize impact
4. All findings will be reported immediately to the security team
5. All testing activities will be logged and documented

## Compliance Requirements

The penetration testing will verify compliance with:

1. HIPAA Security Rule
2. OWASP Top 10
3. NIST Cybersecurity Framework
4. Internal security policies and standards

## Deliverables

1. Penetration Testing Plan (this document)
2. Penetration Testing Report
3. Remediation Plan
4. Remediation Verification Report

## Approval

This penetration testing plan requires approval from:

1. Security Team Lead
2. Development Team Lead
3. Compliance Officer
4. IT Operations Manager
