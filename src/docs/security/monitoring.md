# Security Monitoring and Logging

This document provides an overview of the security monitoring and logging systems implemented in the application.

## Structured Logging

The application uses a structured logging system that provides consistent logging across all components. The logging system includes:

- Request ID tracking for correlating logs across a request lifecycle
- Structured JSON log format for easier parsing and analysis
- Different log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)
- Context enrichment for adding additional information to logs
- Integration with the audit logging system

### Using the Logger

```typescript
import { getLogger } from '../lib/logging';

// Create a logger, optionally with a specific request ID
const logger = getLogger();

// Basic logging
logger.info('This is an informational message');
logger.warn('This is a warning message');
logger.error('This is an error message');
logger.debug('This is a debug message');

// Logging with context
logger.info('User logged in', { userId: '123', ip: '127.0.0.1' });

// Logging errors
try {
  // Some operation that might fail
} catch (error) {
  logger.error('Operation failed', error, { operationId: '456' });
}
```

### Log Levels

The logger supports the following log levels:

- `DEBUG`: Detailed information for debugging purposes
- `INFO`: Informational messages about application progress
- `WARN`: Warning conditions that don't affect normal operation
- `ERROR`: Error conditions that require attention

### Log Rotation

The application implements log rotation to manage log file size and retention:

- Logs are rotated based on file size (default 10MB)
- Rotated logs are compressed to save space
- Old logs are automatically deleted after a configurable number of rotations
- Logs are aggregated for analysis and reporting

## Security Monitoring

The security monitoring system tracks security-related events and provides tools for detecting and responding to security incidents.

### Security Events

The system tracks the following types of security events:

- Failed login attempts
- Excessive API requests
- Suspicious activity patterns
- Access denied events
- API abuse
- Account lockouts

### Event Severity

Security events are categorized by severity:

- `LOW`: Minor issues that don't indicate a security threat
- `MEDIUM`: Issues that might indicate a security problem
- `HIGH`: Significant security issues that require attention
- `CRITICAL`: Serious security issues that require immediate response

### Security Dashboard

The security dashboard provides a visual interface for monitoring security events:

- Real-time view of security events
- Filtering by event type, severity, and time range
- Statistics on event frequency and distribution
- Alert configuration for high-severity events

### Automatic Responses

The system can automatically respond to certain security events:

- Account lockout after multiple failed login attempts
- Rate limiting for excessive API requests
- IP blocking for detected attacks
- Alert generation for security team notification

## Integration

The logging and security monitoring systems are integrated with other system components:

- Middleware for request tracking and logging
- API endpoints for security event querying
- Authentication system for user tracking
- Database storage for persistent event history

## Configuration

Both systems are configurable through environment variables:

```env
# Logging configuration
LOG_LEVEL=info
LOG_CONSOLE=true
LOG_AUDIT=true
LOG_ROTATION_MAX_SIZE=10485760  # 10MB
LOG_ROTATION_MAX_FILES=5
LOG_ROTATION_COMPRESS=true

# Security monitoring configuration
SECURITY_MAX_FAILED_LOGINS=5
SECURITY_FAILED_LOGIN_WINDOW=300
SECURITY_ACCOUNT_LOCKOUT_DURATION=1800
SECURITY_API_ABUSE_THRESHOLD=100
SECURITY_ENABLE_ALERTS=true
```
