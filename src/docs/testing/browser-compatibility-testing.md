# Browser Compatibility Testing Guide

This guide outlines the process for testing our AI components across different browsers to ensure consistent functionality and accessibility.

## Testing Goals

1. Verify that all AI components work correctly across major browsers
2. Ensure accessibility features are supported in all browsers
3. Identify and document any browser-specific issues
4. Verify graceful degradation for unsupported features
5. Ensure consistent visual appearance across browsers

## Supported Browsers

We aim to support the following browsers:

| Browser          | Minimum Version | Priority |
| ---------------- | --------------- | -------- |
| Chrome           | 90+             | High     |
| Firefox          | 90+             | High     |
| Safari           | 14+             | High     |
| Edge             | 90+             | High     |
| iOS Safari       | 14+             | Medium   |
| Android Chrome   | 90+             | Medium   |
| Samsung Internet | 14+             | Low      |

## Testing Process

### 1. Setup Testing Environment

1. Access the browser compatibility testing page at `/dev/browser-compatibility-test`
2. Use real devices when possible, especially for mobile testing
3. For desktop browsers, test with both mouse and keyboard navigation
4. Test with screen readers enabled when testing accessibility features
5. Test with different user preferences (dark mode, reduced motion, high contrast)

### 2. Component Testing

For each component, follow the specific testing instructions on the test page. In general:

#### AI Chat Component

- Verify that the chat interface loads correctly
- Test keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, Arrow keys)
- Test screen reader compatibility
- Verify that messages display correctly
- Test sending and receiving messages
- Verify loading states and animations
- Test with reduced motion preference if available
- Test with high contrast mode if available

#### Loading Indicators

- Verify that loading indicators display correctly
- Test with screen readers to verify announcements
- Test with reduced motion preference if available
- Verify that animations work correctly

### 3. Accessibility Testing

For each component, verify:

- Keyboard navigation works correctly
- Focus indicators are visible
- ARIA attributes are properly supported
- Screen readers announce content correctly
- Color contrast meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- Reduced motion preferences are respected
- High contrast mode is supported

### 4. Reporting Issues

When you encounter an issue:

1. Use the "Compatibility Issues Log" section on the test page
2. Provide detailed information about the browser and issue
3. Include steps to reproduce the issue
4. Specify the severity of the issue
5. Take screenshots if possible and attach them to the issue in our issue tracking system

### 5. Issue Severity Levels

- **Critical**: Blocking functionality, component doesn't work at all
- **Major**: Significant impact on usability, but workarounds exist
- **Minor**: Cosmetic issues, minor visual inconsistencies

## Common Browser-Specific Issues

### Safari

- WebP image format support (use fallbacks)
- Shadow DOM limitations
- CSS Grid implementation differences

### Firefox

- CSS Grid implementation differences
- Some CSS variable scope differences

### Edge

- Generally good compatibility with Chrome-based features

### Mobile Browsers

- Touch event handling differences
- Viewport size handling
- Fixed position elements behavior

## Testing Checklist

Use this checklist for each browser:

- [ ] AI Chat component loads correctly
- [ ] Messages can be sent and received
- [ ] Loading indicators display correctly
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works properly
- [ ] Screen reader announces content correctly
- [ ] Focus indicators are visible
- [ ] Color contrast is sufficient
- [ ] Reduced motion preference is respected
- [ ] High contrast mode is supported
- [ ] Touch interactions work correctly (mobile)
- [ ] Responsive layout adapts correctly
- [ ] No console errors or warnings

## Automated Testing

While manual testing is essential, we also use automated testing tools:

1. **Playwright** for cross-browser automated testing
2. **Axe** for accessibility testing
3. **Lighthouse** for performance and best practices

## Continuous Integration

Our CI pipeline includes:

1. Automated tests for Chrome, Firefox, and Safari
2. Accessibility checks
3. Visual regression tests
