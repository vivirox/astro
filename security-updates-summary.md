All security tests were executed and functioned properly with the updated dependencies.

## Configuration Updates

1. Fixed UnoCSS configuration in `uno.config.ts`:
   - Updated import statements to properly import transformer functions
   - Fixed transformers configuration format

## Security Audit Results

After all updates were completed, a security audit was performed:

```bash
pnpm audit
```

Result: No known vulnerabilities found ✅

The security testing suite was also verified to work with the updated dependencies:

```bash
cd tests/security && ./run-security-tests.sh
```

All security tests completed successfully, demonstrating that the dependency updates did not introduce any regressions in security testing capabilities.

## Future Recommendations

1. Regularly run `pnpm audit` to check for new vulnerabilities
2. Subscribe to security advisories for critical dependencies
3. Consider implementing automated dependency updates using tools like Dependabot
4. Be cautious with beta versions of packages in production environments
5. Keep an eye on the crypto-js package as it has been discontinued by its maintainer
6. Continue to run the comprehensive security tests regularly as part of the CI/CD pipeline
