# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within this project, please send an email to [SECURITY_EMAIL]. All security vulnerabilities will be promptly addressed.

Please include the following information in your report:
- Type of vulnerability
- Full path of source file(s) related to the vulnerability
- Location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the vulnerability
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the vulnerability

## Security Measures

### 1. Access Control
- All repository access must use 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication)
- SSH keys must be rotated every 90 days
- Personal Access Tokens (PATs) must:
  - Have limited scope
  - Expire after 30 days
  - Never be shared or committed to the repository
- Branch protection rules enforce:
  - Required reviews from at least 2 team members
  - Required status checks to pass before merging
  - No direct pushes to main/master branch
  - Linear history (no merge commits)

### 2. Code Security
- All code must pass automated security scanning before merge, including:
  - Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
  - Software Composition Analysis (SCA)
  - Secret scanning
  - Container scanning
  - Infrastructure as Code (IaC) scanning
  - Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Automated scanning configuration:
  - SAST scanning on every pull request
  - Weekly full repository scans
  - Daily dependency vulnerability scans
  - Real-time secret detection
  - Malware detection in dependencies
- Scanning requirements:
  - Zero high-severity issues allowed in main branch
  - All critical vulnerabilities must be addressed within 24 hours
  - Medium severity issues must be addressed within 7 days
  - Dependencies must be kept up-to-date with no known vulnerabilities
  - All security warnings must be resolved or have documented exceptions
- Code signing required for all commits using GPG keys
- Automated security tools configured:
  - CodeQL for SAST
  - Dependabot for dependency scanning
  - GitHub Advanced Security features enabled
  - Container scanning using Trivy
  - IaC scanning using Checkov
- Security scan reports:
  - Automated reports generated after each scan
  - Weekly security metrics collection
  - Monthly trend analysis
  - Quarterly security posture review

### 3. HIPAA Compliance
- PHI (Protected Health Information) must never be committed to the repository
- Test data must be anonymized
- All deployed instances must use HIPAA-compliant infrastructure
- Access logs maintained for audit purposes
- Regular HIPAA compliance training required for all contributors

### 4. Development Practices
- Code review required for all changes
- Secure coding guidelines must be followed
- Regular security training for all developers
- Dependency updates reviewed weekly
- Security incidents documented and reviewed

### 5. Infrastructure Security
- All deployments must use HTTPS
- Production credentials never stored in repository
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) security scanning enabled
- Regular penetration testing performed
- Backup procedures documented and tested

### 6. Incident Response
1. Immediate notification to security team
2. Assessment of vulnerability impact
3. Patch development and testing
4. Coordinated disclosure if necessary
5. Post-incident review and documentation

### 7. Compliance Requirements
- Annual security assessments
- Regular compliance audits
- Documentation of all security measures
- Training records maintained
- Access review quarterly

### 8. Data Protection
- No PHI in repositories
- No credentials in code
- Data encryption in transit and at rest
- Regular backup verification
- Data retention policies enforced
