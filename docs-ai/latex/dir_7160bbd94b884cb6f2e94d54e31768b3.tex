Promises in Node.\+js 10 are significantly faster than before. Bluebird still includes a lot of features like cancellation, iteration methods and warnings that native promises don\textquotesingle{}t. If you are using Bluebird for performance rather than for those -\/ please consider giving native promises a shot and running the benchmarks yourself.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md9434}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Questions and issues}{Questions and issues}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md9434}
