\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Provides a Node.\+js generator to produce Dockerfiles and related files. It is intended to support any framework that lists its dependencies, includes a {\ttfamily start} script in {\ttfamily package.\+json}, and optionally includes a {\ttfamily build} script.

See \href{./test}{\texttt{ test}} for a list of frameworks and examples of Dockerfiles produced based on the associated {\ttfamily package.\+json} and lock files.

See \href{https://fly.io/blog/flydotio-heart-js/}{\texttt{ blog post}} for more information.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md3379}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Usage}{Usage}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md3379}
To run once\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{npx\ -\/-\/yes\ @flydotio/dockerfile@latest}
\DoxyCodeLine{bunx\ -\/-\/bun\ @flydotio/dockerfile@latest}

\end{DoxyCode}


Or install it with your favorite package manager\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{bun\ add\ -\/d\ @flydotio/dockerfile}
\DoxyCodeLine{npm\ install\ @flydotio/dockerfile\ -\/-\/save-\/dev}
\DoxyCodeLine{pnpm\ add\ -\/D\ @flydotio/dockerfile}
\DoxyCodeLine{yarn\ add\ @flydotio/dockerfile\ -\/-\/dev}

\end{DoxyCode}


Once installed, you can run and re-\/run using {\ttfamily npx dockerfile} for Node.\+js applications or {\ttfamily bunx -\/-\/bun dockerfile} for Bun applications.

Options are saved between runs into {\ttfamily package.\+json}. To invert a boolean options, add or remove a no-\/ prefix from the option name.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md3380}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Options\+:}{Options\+:}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md3380}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily -\/-\/alpine} -\/ use \href{https://www.alpinelinux.org/}{\texttt{ alpine}} as base image
\item {\ttfamily -\/-\/build=CMD} -\/ command to be used to build your application.
\item {\ttfamily -\/-\/cache} -\/ use build caching to speed up builds
\item {\ttfamily -\/-\/cmd=CMD} -\/ CMD to use in Dockerfile
\item {\ttfamily -\/-\/defer-\/build} -\/ may be needed when your build step requires access to secrets that are not available at image build time. Results in larger images and slower deployments.
\item {\ttfamily -\/-\/dev} -\/ include {\ttfamily dev\+Dependencies} in the production image.
\item {\ttfamily -\/-\/distroless} -\/ use \href{https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless}{\texttt{ distroless}} base image to reduce image size
\item {\ttfamily -\/-\/entrypoint} -\/ ENTRYPOINT to use in Dockerfile
\item {\ttfamily -\/-\/ignore-\/scripts} -\/ do not execute any scripts defined in the project {\ttfamily package.\+json} and its dependencies.
\item {\ttfamily -\/-\/force} -\/ overwrite existing files
\item {\ttfamily -\/-\/legacy-\/peer-\/deps} -\/ \href{https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/config\#legacy-peer-deps}{\texttt{ ignore peer dependencies}}.
\item {\ttfamily -\/-\/litefs} -\/ configure and enable \href{https://fly.io/docs/litefs/}{\texttt{ litefs}}.
\item {\ttfamily -\/-\/litestream} -\/ configure and enable \href{https://litestream.io/}{\texttt{ litestream}}.
\item {\ttfamily -\/-\/nginx\+Root=DIR} -\/ serve static files from given directory via \href{https://www.nginx.com/}{\texttt{ nginx}}.
\item {\ttfamily -\/-\/link} -\/ Add \href{https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/\#copy---link}{\texttt{ --link}} to COPY statements. Some tools, including \href{https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/containers/what-is-buildah}{\texttt{ buildah}}) or \href{https://docs.docker.com/build/buildkit/}{\texttt{ Buildkit}} don\textquotesingle{}t properly support this feature.
\item {\ttfamily -\/-\/port=n} -\/ expose port (default may vary based on framework, but otherwise is {\ttfamily 3000})
\item {\ttfamily -\/-\/swap=n} -\/ allocate swap space. See \href{https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/fallocate.1.html\#OPTIONS}{\texttt{ falloc options}} for suffixes
\item {\ttfamily -\/-\/windows} -\/ make Dockerfile work for Windows users that may have set {\ttfamily git config -\/-\/global core.\+autocrlf true}.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md3381}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Add a package/environment variable/build argument\+:}{Add a package/environment variable/build argument\+:}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md3381}
Not all of your needs can be determined by scanning your application. For example, I like to add \href{https://www.vim.org/}{\texttt{ vim}} and \href{https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/procps}{\texttt{ procps}}.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily -\/-\/add package...} -\/ add one or more debian packages
\item {\ttfamily -\/-\/arg=name\+:value} -\/ add a \href{https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/\#arg}{\texttt{ build argument}}
\item {\ttfamily -\/-\/env=name\+:value} -\/ add an environment variable
\item {\ttfamily -\/-\/remove package...} -\/ remove package from "{}to be added"{} list
\end{DoxyItemize}

Args and environment variables can be tailored to a specific build phase by adding {\ttfamily -\/base}, {\ttfamily -\/build}, or {\ttfamily -\/deploy} after the flag name (e.\+g {\ttfamily -\/-\/add-\/build freetds-\/dev -\/-\/add-\/deploy freetds-\/bin}). If no such suffix is found, the default for arg is {\ttfamily -\/base}, and the default for env is {\ttfamily -\/deploy}. Removal of an arg or environment variable is done by leaving the value blank (e.\+g {\ttfamily -\/-\/env-\/build=PORT\+:}).\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md3382}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Build secrets}{Build secrets}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md3382}
Techniques such as static site generation using databases may require access to secrets at build time. To enable this you will need to {\itshape mount} the secret\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily -\/-\/mount-\/secret=name} -\/ add {\itshape name} to the list of secrets to mount when running the build script
\item {\ttfamily -\/-\/unmount-\/secret-\/name} -\/ remove {\itshape name} from the list of secrets to mount when running the build script
\end{DoxyItemize}

See \href{https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/buildx_build/\#secret}{\texttt{ Secret to expose to the build}} for examples on how to pass secrets to a docker build.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md3383}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Advanced customization}{Advanced customization}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md3383}
There may be times where feature detection plus flags just aren\textquotesingle{}t enough. As an example, you may wish to configure and run multiple processes.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily -\/-\/instructions=path} -\/ a dockerfile fragment to be inserted into the final document.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Like with environment variables, packages, and build args, {\ttfamily -\/-\/instructions} can be tailored to a specific build phase by adding {\ttfamily -\/base}, {\ttfamily -\/build}, or {\ttfamily -\/deploy} after the flag name, with the default being {\ttfamily -\/deploy}.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md3384}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Platform specific processing}{Platform specific processing}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md3384}
In addition to creating Dockerfiles and associated artifacts, {\ttfamily dockerfile-\/node} can run platform specific processing. At the present time the first and only platform taking advantage of this is naturally fly.\+io.

If, and only if, {\ttfamily flyctl} is installed, part of the path, and there exists a valid {\ttfamily fly.\+toml} file in the current directory, dockerfile-\/node will\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item configure and create volume(s) for sqlite3
\item set swapfile size if that option is selected
\item attach consul for litefs
\item set secrets for remix and adonis apps
\item initialize git
\item define a staging app if one is mentioned in {\ttfamily .github/workflows/deploy.\+yml}
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md3385}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Testing}{Testing}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md3385}
A single invocation of {\ttfamily npm test} will run all of the tests defined. Additionally {\ttfamily npm run eslint} will run eslint.

The current integration testing strategy is to run the dockerfile generator against various configurations and compare the generated artifacts with expected results. {\ttfamily ARG} values in {\ttfamily Dockerfiles} are masked before comparison.

To assist with this process, outputs of tests can be captured automatically. This is useful when adding new tests and when making a change that affects many tests. Be sure to inspect the output (e.\+g., by using {\ttfamily git diff}) before committing.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{npm\ run\ test:capture}

\end{DoxyCode}


To run a single test (or tests maching a pattern), run mocha directly with the {\ttfamily grep} option.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{npx\ mocha\ -\/-\/grep\ swap}

\end{DoxyCode}


Additionally, each the outputs in each test directory can be directly tested to ensure that they can be successfully built by running docker buildx directory passing in the necessary build arguments. For example\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{docker\ buildx\ build\ .\ -\/-\/build-\/arg\ NODE\_VERSION=18}

\end{DoxyCode}
