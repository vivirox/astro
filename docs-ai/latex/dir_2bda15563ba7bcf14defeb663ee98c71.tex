\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
A cache object that deletes the least-\/recently-\/used items.

Specify a max number of the most recently used items that you want to keep, and this cache will keep that many of the most recently accessed items.

This is not primarily a TTL cache, and does not make strong TTL guarantees. There is no preemptive pruning of expired items by default, but you {\itshape may} set a TTL on the cache or on a single {\ttfamily set}. If you do so, it will treat expired items as missing, and delete them when fetched. If you are more interested in TTL caching than LRU caching, check out \href{http://npm.im/@isaacs/ttlcache}{\texttt{ @isaacs/ttlcache}}.

As of version 7, this is one of the most performant LRU implementations available in Java\+Script, and supports a wide diversity of use cases. However, note that using some of the features will necessarily impact performance, by causing the cache to have to do more work. See the "{}\+Performance"{} section below.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md22114}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Installation}{Installation}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md22114}

If you put more stuff in the cache, then less recently used items will fall out. That\textquotesingle{}s what an LRU cache is.

For full description of the API and all options, please see \href{https://isaacs.github.io/node-lru-cache/}{\texttt{ the LRUCache typedocs}}\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md22116}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Storage Bounds Safety}{Storage Bounds Safety}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md22116}
This implementation aims to be as flexible as possible, within the limits of safe memory consumption and optimal performance.

At initial object creation, storage is allocated for {\ttfamily max} items. If {\ttfamily max} is set to zero, then some performance is lost, and item count is unbounded. Either {\ttfamily max\+Size} or {\ttfamily ttl} {\itshape must} be set if {\ttfamily max} is not specified.

If {\ttfamily max\+Size} is set, then this creates a safe limit on the maximum storage consumed, but without the performance benefits of pre-\/allocation. When {\ttfamily max\+Size} is set, every item {\itshape must} provide a size, either via the {\ttfamily size\+Calculation} method provided to the constructor, or via a {\ttfamily size} or {\ttfamily size\+Calculation} option provided to {\ttfamily cache.\+set()}. The size of every item {\itshape must} be a positive integer.

If neither {\ttfamily max} nor {\ttfamily max\+Size} are set, then {\ttfamily ttl} tracking must be enabled. Note that, even when tracking item {\ttfamily ttl}, items are {\itshape not} preemptively deleted when they become stale, unless {\ttfamily ttl\+Autopurge} is enabled. Instead, they are only purged the next time the key is requested. Thus, if {\ttfamily ttl\+Autopurge}, {\ttfamily max}, and {\ttfamily max\+Size} are all not set, then the cache will potentially grow unbounded.

In this case, a warning is printed to standard error. Future versions may require the use of {\ttfamily ttl\+Autopurge} if {\ttfamily max} and {\ttfamily max\+Size} are not specified.

If you truly wish to use a cache that is bound {\itshape only} by TTL expiration, consider using a {\ttfamily Map} object, and calling {\ttfamily set\+Timeout} to delete entries when they expire. It will perform much better than an LRU cache.

Here is an implementation you may use, under the same \href{./LICENSE}{\texttt{ license}} as this package\+:

\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ cache.timers.set(}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ \ \ k,}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ \ \ setTimeout(()\ =>\ cache.delete(k),\ ttl)}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ )}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ cache.data.set(k,\ v)}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \},}

If that isn\textquotesingle{}t to your liking, check out \href{http://npm.im/@isaacs/ttlcache}{\texttt{ @isaacs/ttlcache}}.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md22117}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Storing Undefined Values}{Storing Undefined Values}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md22117}
This cache never stores undefined values, as {\ttfamily undefined} is used internally in a few places to indicate that a key is not in the cache.

You may call {\ttfamily cache.\+set(key, undefined)}, but this is just an alias for {\ttfamily cache.\+delete(key)}. Note that this has the effect that {\ttfamily cache.\+has(key)} will return {\itshape false} after setting it to undefined.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cache.set(myKey,\ undefined)}
\DoxyCodeLine{cache.has(myKey)\ //\ false!}

\end{DoxyCode}


If you need to track {\ttfamily undefined} values, and still note that the key is in the cache, an easy workaround is to use a sigil object of your own.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{import\ \{\ LRUCache\ \}\ from\ 'lru-\/cache'}
\DoxyCodeLine{const\ undefinedValue\ =\ Symbol('undefined')}
\DoxyCodeLine{const\ cache\ =\ new\ LRUCache(...)}
\DoxyCodeLine{const\ mySet\ =\ (key,\ value)\ =>}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ cache.set(key,\ value\ ===\ undefined\ ?\ undefinedValue\ :\ value)}
\DoxyCodeLine{const\ myGet\ =\ (key,\ value)\ =>\ \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ const\ v\ =\ cache.get(key)}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ return\ v\ ===\ undefinedValue\ ?\ undefined\ :\ v}
\DoxyCodeLine{\}}

\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md22118}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Performance}{Performance}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md22118}
As of January 2022, version 7 of this library is one of the most performant LRU cache implementations in Java\+Script.

Benchmarks can be extremely difficult to get right. In particular, the performance of set/get/delete operations on objects will vary {\itshape wildly} depending on the type of key used. V8 is highly optimized for objects with keys that are short strings, especially integer numeric strings. Thus any benchmark which tests {\itshape solely} using numbers as keys will tend to find that an object-\/based approach performs the best.

Note that coercing {\itshape anything} to strings to use as object keys is unsafe, unless you can be 100\% certain that no other type of value will be used. For example\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{const\ myCache\ =\ \{\}}
\DoxyCodeLine{const\ set\ =\ (k,\ v)\ =>\ (myCache[k]\ =\ v)}
\DoxyCodeLine{const\ get\ =\ k\ =>\ myCache[k]}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{set(\{\},\ 'please\ hang\ onto\ this\ for\ me')}
\DoxyCodeLine{set('[object\ Object]',\ 'oopsie')}

\end{DoxyCode}


Also beware of "{}\+Just So"{} stories regarding performance. Garbage collection of large (especially\+: deep) object graphs can be incredibly costly, with several "{}tipping points"{} where it increases exponentially. As a result, putting that off until later can make it much worse, and less predictable. If a library performs well, but only in a scenario where the object graph is kept shallow, then that won\textquotesingle{}t help you if you are using large objects as keys.

In general, when attempting to use a library to improve performance (such as a cache like this one), it\textquotesingle{}s best to choose an option that will perform well in the sorts of scenarios where you\textquotesingle{}ll actually use it.

This library is optimized for repeated gets and minimizing eviction time, since that is the expected need of a LRU. Set operations are somewhat slower on average than a few other options, in part because of that optimization. It is assumed that you\textquotesingle{}ll be caching some costly operation, ideally as rarely as possible, so optimizing set over get would be unwise.

If performance matters to you\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item If it\textquotesingle{}s at all possible to use small integer values as keys, and you can guarantee that no other types of values will be used as keys, then do that, and use a cache such as \href{https://npmjs.com/package/lru-fast}{\texttt{ lru-\/fast}}, or \href{https://yomguithereal.github.io/mnemonist/lru-cache}{\texttt{ mnemonist\textquotesingle{}s LRUCache}} which uses an Object as its data store.
\item Failing that, if at all possible, use short non-\/numeric strings (ie, less than 256 characters) as your keys, and use \href{https://yomguithereal.github.io/mnemonist/lru-cache}{\texttt{ mnemonist\textquotesingle{}s LRUCache}}.
\item If the types of your keys will be anything else, especially long strings, strings that look like floats, objects, or some mix of types, or if you aren\textquotesingle{}t sure, then this library will work well for you.

If you do not need the features that this library provides (like asynchronous fetching, a variety of TTL staleness options, and so on), then \href{https://yomguithereal.github.io/mnemonist/lru-map}{\texttt{ mnemonist\textquotesingle{}s LRUMap}} is a very good option, and just slightly faster than this module (since it does considerably less).
\item Do not use a {\ttfamily dispose} function, size tracking, or especially ttl behavior, unless absolutely needed. These features are convenient, and necessary in some use cases, and every attempt has been made to make the performance impact minimal, but it isn\textquotesingle{}t nothing.

This library changed to a different algorithm and internal data structure in version 7, yielding significantly better performance, albeit with some subtle changes as a result.

If you were relying on the internals of LRUCache in version 6 or before, it probably will not work in version 7 and above.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md22120}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Breaking Changes in Version 8}{Breaking Changes in Version 8}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md22120}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The {\ttfamily fetch\+Context} option was renamed to {\ttfamily context}, and may no longer be set on the cache instance itself.
\item Rewritten in Type\+Script, so pretty much all the types moved around a lot.
\item The Abort\+Controller/\+Abort\+Signal polyfill was removed. For this reason, {\bfseries{Node version 16.\+14.\+0 or higher is now required}}.
\item Internal properties were moved to actual private class properties.
\item Keys and values must not be {\ttfamily null} or {\ttfamily undefined}.
\item Minified export available at `\textquotesingle{}lru-\/cache/min'\`{}, for both CJS and MJS builds.
