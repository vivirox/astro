It used to be that the library was contained in a single file and you could just import/require/what-\/have-\/you the {\ttfamily xmlchars} module. However, that setup did not work well for people who cared about code optimization. Importing {\ttfamily xmlchars} meant importing {\itshape all} of the library and because of the way the code was generated there was no way to shake the resulting code tree.

Different modules cover different standards. At the time this documentation was last updated, we had\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily xmlchars/xml/1.\+0/ed5} which covers XML 1.\+0 edition 5.
\item {\ttfamily xmlchars/xml/1.\+0/ed4} which covers XML 1.\+0 edition 4.
\item {\ttfamily xmlchars/xml/1.\+1/ed2} which covers XML 1.\+0 edition 2.
\item {\ttfamily xmlchars/xmlns/1.\+0/ed3} which covers XML Namespaces 1.\+0 edition 3.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md35829}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Features}{Features}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md35829}
The "{}things"{} each module contains can be categorized as follows\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item "{}\+Fragments"{}\+: these are parts and pieces of regular expressions that correspond to the productions defined in the standard that the module covers. You\textquotesingle{}d use these to {\itshape build regular expressions}.
\item Regular expressions that correspond to the productions defined in the standard that the module covers.
\item Lists\+: these are arrays of characters that correspond to the productions.
\item Functions that test code points to verify whether they fit a production.
