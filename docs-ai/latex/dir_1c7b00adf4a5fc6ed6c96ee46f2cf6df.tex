As of {\ttfamily jest@\texorpdfstring{$^\wedge$}{\string^}24.4.\+0} you don\textquotesingle{}t need to manually add this package anymore. The default resolver will already use PnP.

Simply add the resolver to your configuration. For example, a minimal {\ttfamily jest.\+config.\+js} would be as such\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{module.exports\ =\ \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ resolver:\ require.resolve(`jest-\/pnp-\/resolver`)}
\DoxyCodeLine{\};}
