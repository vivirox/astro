\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
A helper module to use emmet modules with Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code extensions that provide language service and want to provide emmet abbreviation expansions in auto-\/complete can include this module and use the {\ttfamily do\+Complete} method. Just pass the one of the emmet supported syntaxes that you would like the completion provider to use along with other parameters that you would generally pass to a completion provider.

If {\ttfamily emmet.\+include\+Languages} has a mapping for your language, then the builit-\/in emmet extension will provide html emmet abbreviations. Ask the user to remove the mapping, if your extension decides to provide emmet completions using this module
