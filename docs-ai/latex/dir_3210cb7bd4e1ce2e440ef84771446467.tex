Buffers events from a stream until you are ready to handle them.\hypertarget{Readme.md_autotoc_md11759}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Installation}{Installation}}\label{Readme.md_autotoc_md11759}

The following example shows how to write a http echo server that delays its response by 1000 ms.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ javascript}
\DoxyCodeLine{var\ DelayedStream\ =\ require('delayed-\/stream');}
\DoxyCodeLine{var\ http\ =\ require('http');}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{http.createServer(function(req,\ res)\ \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ var\ delayed\ =\ DelayedStream.create(req);}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ setTimeout(function()\ \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ res.writeHead(200);}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ delayed.pipe(res);}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \},\ 1000);}
\DoxyCodeLine{\});}

\end{DoxyCode}


If you are not using {\ttfamily Stream\#pipe}, you can also manually release the buffered events by calling {\ttfamily delayed\+Stream.\+resume()}\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ javascript}
\DoxyCodeLine{var\ delayed\ =\ DelayedStream.create(req);}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{setTimeout(function()\ \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ //\ Emit\ all\ buffered\ events\ and\ resume\ underlaying\ source}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ delayed.resume();}
\DoxyCodeLine{\},\ 1000);}

\end{DoxyCode}

In order to use this meta stream properly, here are a few things you should know about the implementation.\hypertarget{Readme.md_autotoc_md11762}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Event Buffering / Proxying}{Event Buffering / Proxying}}\label{Readme.md_autotoc_md11762}
All events of the {\ttfamily source} stream are hijacked by overwriting the {\ttfamily source.\+emit} method. Until node implements a catch-\/all event listener, this is the only way.

However, delayed-\/stream still continues to emit all events it captures on the {\ttfamily source}, regardless of whether you have released the delayed stream yet or not.

Upon creation, delayed-\/stream captures all {\ttfamily source} events and stores them in an internal event buffer. Once {\ttfamily delayed\+Stream.\+release()} is called, all buffered events are emitted on the {\ttfamily delayed\+Stream}, and the event buffer is cleared. After that, delayed-\/stream merely acts as a proxy for the underlaying source.\hypertarget{Readme.md_autotoc_md11763}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Error handling}{Error handling}}\label{Readme.md_autotoc_md11763}
Error events on {\ttfamily source} are buffered / proxied just like any other events. However, {\ttfamily delayed\+Stream.\+create} attaches a no-\/op `\textquotesingle{}error'{\ttfamily listener to the }source{\ttfamily . This way you only have to handle errors on the}delayed\+Stream\`{} object, rather than in two places.\hypertarget{Readme.md_autotoc_md11764}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Buffer limits}{Buffer limits}}\label{Readme.md_autotoc_md11764}
delayed-\/stream provides a {\ttfamily max\+Data\+Size} property that can be used to limit the amount of data being buffered. In order to protect you from bad {\ttfamily source} streams that don\textquotesingle{}t react to {\ttfamily source.\+pause()}, this feature is enabled by default.\hypertarget{Readme.md_autotoc_md11765}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{API}{API}}\label{Readme.md_autotoc_md11765}
\hypertarget{Readme.md_autotoc_md11766}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Delayed\+Stream.\+create(source, \mbox{[}options\mbox{]})}{Delayed\+Stream.\+create(source, \mbox{[}options\mbox{]})}}\label{Readme.md_autotoc_md11766}
Returns a new {\ttfamily delayed\+Stream}. Available options are\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily pause\+Stream}
\item {\ttfamily max\+Data\+Size}
\end{DoxyItemize}

The description for those properties can be found below.\hypertarget{Readme.md_autotoc_md11767}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{delayed\+Stream.\+source}{delayed\+Stream.\+source}}\label{Readme.md_autotoc_md11767}
The {\ttfamily source} stream managed by this object. This is useful if you are passing your {\ttfamily delayed\+Stream} around, and you still want to access properties on the {\ttfamily source} object.\hypertarget{Readme.md_autotoc_md11768}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{delayed\+Stream.\+pause\+Stream = true}{delayed\+Stream.\+pause\+Stream = true}}\label{Readme.md_autotoc_md11768}
Whether to pause the underlaying {\ttfamily source} when calling {\ttfamily Delayed\+Stream.\+create()}. Modifying this property afterwards has no effect.\hypertarget{Readme.md_autotoc_md11769}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{delayed\+Stream.\+max\+Data\+Size = 1024 \texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*} 1024}{delayed\+Stream.\+max\+Data\+Size = 1024 \texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*} 1024}}\label{Readme.md_autotoc_md11769}
The amount of data to buffer before emitting an {\ttfamily error}.

If the underlaying source is emitting {\ttfamily Buffer} objects, the {\ttfamily max\+Data\+Size} refers to bytes.

If the underlaying source is emitting Java\+Script strings, the size refers to characters.

If you know what you are doing, you can set this property to {\ttfamily Infinity} to disable this feature. You can also modify this property during runtime.\hypertarget{Readme.md_autotoc_md11770}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{delayed\+Stream.\+data\+Size = 0}{delayed\+Stream.\+data\+Size = 0}}\label{Readme.md_autotoc_md11770}

In either case, {\ttfamily source.\+resume()} is called.\hypertarget{Readme.md_autotoc_md11773}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{delayed\+Stream.\+pause()}{delayed\+Stream.\+pause()}}\label{Readme.md_autotoc_md11773}
