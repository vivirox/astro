The modules found in {\ttfamily core/} should be modules that are specific to the domain logic of axios. These modules would most likely not make sense to be consumed outside of the axios module, as their logic is too specific. Some examples of core modules are\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Dispatching requests
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Requests sent via {\ttfamily adapters/} (see lib/adapters/\+README.\+md)
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Managing interceptors
\item Handling config 
\end{DoxyItemize}
