\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
A sax-\/style non-\/validating parser for XML.

Saxes is a fork of \href{https://github.com/isaacs/sax-js}{\texttt{ sax}} 1.\+2.\+4. All mentions of sax in this project\textquotesingle{}s documentation are references to sax 1.\+2.\+4.

Designed with \href{http://nodejs.org/}{\texttt{ node}} in mind, but should work fine in the browser or other Common\+JS implementations.

Saxes does not support Node versions older than 10.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md30280}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Notable Differences from Sax.}{Notable Differences from Sax.}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md30280}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Saxes aims to be much stricter than sax with regards to XML well-\/formedness. Sax, even in its so-\/called "{}strict mode"{}, is not strict. It silently accepts structures that are not well-\/formed XML. Projects that need better compliance with well-\/formedness constraints cannot use sax as-\/is.

Consequently, saxes does not support HTML, or pseudo-\/\+XML, or bad XML. Saxes will report well-\/formedness errors in all these cases but it won\textquotesingle{}t try to extract data from malformed documents like sax does.
\item Saxes is much much faster than sax, mostly because of a substantial redesign of the internal parsing logic. The speed improvement is not merely due to removing features that were supported by sax. That helped a bit, but saxes adds some expensive checks in its aim for conformance with the XML specification. Redesigning the parsing logic is what accounts for most of the performance improvement.
\item Saxes does not aim to support antiquated platforms. We will not pollute the source or the default build with support for antiquated platforms. If you want support for IE 11, you are welcome to produce a PR that adds a {\itshape new build} transpiled to ES5.
\item Saxes handles errors differently from sax\+: it provides a default onerror handler which throws. You can replace it with your own handler if you want. If your handler does nothing, there is no {\ttfamily resume} method to call.
\item There\textquotesingle{}s no {\ttfamily Stream} API. A revamped API may be introduced later. (It is still a "{}streaming parser"{} in the general sense that you write a character stream to it.)
\item Saxes does not have facilities for limiting the size the data chunks passed to event handlers. See the FAQ entry for more details.

This is a non-\/validating parser so it only verifies whether the document is well-\/formed. We do aim to raise errors for all malformed constructs encountered. However, this parser does not thorougly parse the contents of DTDs. So most malformedness errors caused by errors {\bfseries{in DTDs}} cannot be reported.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md30283}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Regarding {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}!\+DOCTYPE} and {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}!\+ENTITY}}{Regarding {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}!\+DOCTYPE} and {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}!\+ENTITY}}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md30283}
The parser will handle the basic XML entities in text nodes and attribute values\+: {\ttfamily \&amp; \&lt; \&gt; \&apos; \&quot;}. It\textquotesingle{}s possible to define additional entities in XML by putting them in the DTD. This parser doesn\textquotesingle{}t do anything with that. If you want to listen to the {\ttfamily doctype} event, and then fetch the doctypes, and read the entities and add them to {\ttfamily parser.\+ENTITIES}, then be my guest.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md30284}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Documentation}{Documentation}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md30284}

Settings supported\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily xmlns} -\/ Boolean. If {\ttfamily true}, then namespaces are supported. Default is {\ttfamily false}.
\item {\ttfamily position} -\/ Boolean. If {\ttfamily false}, then don\textquotesingle{}t track line/col/position. Unset is treated as {\ttfamily true}. Default is unset. Currently, setting this to {\ttfamily false} only results in a cosmetic change\+: the errors reported do not contain position information. sax-\/js would literally turn off the position-\/computing logic if this flag was set to false. The notion was that it would optimize execution. In saxes at least it turns out that continually testing this flag causes a cost that offsets the benefits of turning off this logic.
\item {\ttfamily file\+Name} -\/ String. Set a file name for error reporting. This is useful only when tracking positions. You may leave it unset.
\item {\ttfamily fragment} -\/ Boolean. If {\ttfamily true}, parse the XML as an XML fragment. Default is {\ttfamily false}.
\item {\ttfamily additional\+Namespaces} -\/ A plain object whose key, value pairs define namespaces known before parsing the XML file. It is not legal to pass bindings for the namespaces {\ttfamily "{}xml"{}} or {\ttfamily "{}xmlns"{}}.
\item {\ttfamily default\+XMLVersion} -\/ The default version of the XML specification to use if the document contains no XML declaration. If the document does contain an XML declaration, then this setting is ignored. Must be {\ttfamily "{}1.\+0"{}} or {\ttfamily "{}1.\+1"{}}. The default is {\ttfamily "{}1.\+0"{}}.
\item {\ttfamily force\+XMLVersion} -\/ Boolean. A flag indicating whether to force the XML version used for parsing to the value of {\ttfamily default\+XMLVersion}. When this flag is {\ttfamily true}, {\ttfamily default\+XMLVersion} must be specified. If unspecified, the default value of this flag is {\ttfamily false}.

Example\+: suppose you are parsing a document that has an XML declaration specifying XML version 1.\+1.

If you set {\ttfamily default\+XMLVersion} to {\ttfamily "{}1.\+0"{}} without setting {\ttfamily force\+XMLVersion} then the XML declaration will override the value of {\ttfamily default\+XMLVersion} and the document will be parsed according to XML 1.\+1.

If you set {\ttfamily default\+XMLVersion} to {\ttfamily "{}1.\+0"{}} and set {\ttfamily force\+XMLVersion} to {\ttfamily true}, then the XML declaration will be ignored and the document will be parsed according to XML 1.\+0.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md30288}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Methods}{Methods}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md30288}
{\ttfamily write} -\/ Write bytes onto the stream. You don\textquotesingle{}t have to pass the whole document in one {\ttfamily write} call. You can read your source chunk by chunk and call {\ttfamily write} with each chunk.

{\ttfamily close} -\/ Close the stream. Once closed, no more data may be written until it is done processing the buffer, which is signaled by the {\ttfamily end} event.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md30289}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Properties}{Properties}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md30289}
The parser has the following properties\+:

{\ttfamily line}, {\ttfamily column}, {\ttfamily column\+Index}, {\ttfamily position} -\/ Indications of the position in the XML document where the parser currently is looking. The {\ttfamily column\+Index} property counts columns as if indexing into a Java\+Script string, whereas the {\ttfamily column} property counts Unicode characters.

{\ttfamily closed} -\/ Boolean indicating whether or not the parser can be written to. If it\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily true}, then wait for the {\ttfamily ready} event to write again.

{\ttfamily opt} -\/ Any options passed into the constructor.

{\ttfamily xml\+Decl} -\/ The XML declaration for this document. It contains the fields {\ttfamily version}, {\ttfamily encoding} and {\ttfamily standalone}. They are all {\ttfamily undefined} before encountering the XML declaration. If they are undefined after the XML declaration, the corresponding value was not set by the declaration. There is no event associated with the XML declaration. In a well-\/formed document, the XML declaration may be preceded only by an optional BOM. So by the time any event generated by the parser happens, the declaration has been processed if present at all. Otherwise, you have a malformed document, and as stated above, you cannot rely on the parser data!\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md30290}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Error Handling}{Error Handling}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md30290}
The parser continues to parse even upon encountering errors, and does its best to continue reporting errors. You should heed all errors reported. After an error, however, saxes may interpret your document incorrectly. For instance {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}foo a=bc="{}d"{}/\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}} is invalid XML. Did you mean to have {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}foo a="{}bc=d"{}/\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}} or {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}foo a="{}b"{} c="{}d"{}/\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}} or some other variation? For the sake of continuing to provide errors, saxes will continue parsing the document, but the structure it reports may be incorrect. It is only after the errors are fixed in the document that saxes can provide a reliable interpretation of the document.

That leaves you with two rules of thumb when using saxes\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Pay attention to the errors that saxes report. The default {\ttfamily onerror} handler throws, so by default, you cannot miss errors.
\item {\bfseries{ONCE AN ERROR HAS BEEN ENCOUNTERED, STOP RELYING ON THE EVENT HANDLERS OTHER THAN {\ttfamily onerror}.}} As explained above, when saxes runs into a well-\/formedness problem, it makes a guess in order to continue reporting more errors. The guess may be wrong.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md30291}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Events}{Events}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md30291}
To listen to an event, override {\ttfamily on\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}eventname\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}}. The list of supported events are also in the exported {\ttfamily EVENTS} array.

See the JSDOC comments in the source code for a description of each supported event.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md30292}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Parsing XML Fragments}{Parsing XML Fragments}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md30292}
The XML specification does not define any method by which to parse XML fragments. However, there are usage scenarios in which it is desirable to parse fragments. In order to allow this, saxes provides three initialization options.

If you pass the option {\ttfamily fragment\+: true} to the parser constructor, the parser will expect an XML fragment. It essentially starts with a parsing state equivalent to the one it would be in if {\ttfamily parser.\+write("{}$<$foo"{}\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>})} had been called right after initialization. In other words, it expects content which is acceptable inside an element. This also turns off well-\/formedness checks that are inappropriate when parsing a fragment.

The option {\ttfamily additional\+Namespaces} allows you to define additional prefix-\/to-\/\+URI bindings known before parsing starts. You would use this over {\ttfamily resolve\+Prefix} if you have at the ready a series of namespaces bindings to use.

The option {\ttfamily resolve\+Prefix} allows you to pass a function which saxes will use if it is unable to resolve a namespace prefix by itself. You would use this over {\ttfamily additional\+Namespaces} in a context where getting a complete list of defined namespaces is onerous.

Note that you can use {\ttfamily additional\+Namespaces} and {\ttfamily resolve\+Prefix} together if you want. {\ttfamily additional\+Namespaces} applies before {\ttfamily resolve\+Prefix}.

The options {\ttfamily additional\+Namespaces} and {\ttfamily resolve\+Prefix} are really meant to be used for parsing fragments. However, saxes won\textquotesingle{}t prevent you from using them with {\ttfamily fragment\+: false}. Note that if you do this, your document may parse without errors and yet be malformed because the document can refer to namespaces which are not defined {\itshape in} the document.

Of course, {\ttfamily additional\+Namespaces} and {\ttfamily resolve\+Prefix} are used only if {\ttfamily xmlns} is {\ttfamily true}. If you are parsing a fragment that does not use namespaces, there\textquotesingle{}s no point in setting these options.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md30293}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Performance Tips}{Performance Tips}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md30293}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item saxes works faster on files that use newlines ({\ttfamily \textbackslash{}u000A}) as end of line markers than files that use other end of line markers (like {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}r} or {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}r\textbackslash{}n}). The XML specification requires that conformant applications behave as if all characters that are to be treated as end of line characters are converted to {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}u000A} prior to parsing. The optimal code path for saxes is a file in which all end of line characters are already {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}u000A}.
\item Don\textquotesingle{}t split Unicode strings you feed to saxes across surrogates. When you naively split a string in Java\+Script, you run the risk of splitting a Unicode character into two surrogates. e.\+g. In the following example {\ttfamily a} and {\ttfamily b} each contain half of a single Unicode character\+: {\ttfamily const a = "{}\textbackslash{}u\{1\+F4\+A9\}"{}\mbox{[}0\mbox{]}; const b = "{}\textbackslash{}u\{1\+F4\+A9\}"{}\mbox{[}1\mbox{]}} If you feed such split surrogates to versions of saxes prior to 4, you\textquotesingle{}d get errors. Saxes version 4 and over are able to detect when a chunk of data ends with a surrogate and carry over the surrogate to the next chunk. However this operation entails slicing and concatenating strings. If you can feed your data in a way that does not split surrogates, you should do it. (Obviously, feeding all the data at once with a single write is fastest.)
\item Don\textquotesingle{}t set event handlers you don\textquotesingle{}t need. Saxes has always aimed to avoid doing work that will just be tossed away but future improvements hope to do this more aggressively. One way saxes knows whether or not some data is needed is by checking whether a handler has been set for a specific event.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md30294}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{FAQ}{FAQ}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md30294}
Q. Why has saxes dropped support for limiting the size of data chunks passed to event handlers?

A. With sax you could set {\ttfamily MAX\+\_\+\+BUFFER\+\_\+\+LENGTH} to cause the parser to limit the size of data chunks passed to event handlers. So if you ran into a span of text above the limit, multiple {\ttfamily text} events with smaller data chunks were fired instead of a single event with a large chunk.

However, that functionality had some problematic characteristics. It had an arbitrary default value. It was library-\/wide so all parsers created from a single instance of the {\ttfamily sax} library shared it. This could potentially cause conflicts among libraries running in the same VM but using sax for different purposes.

These issues could have been easily fixed, but there were larger issues. The buffer limit arbitrarily applied to some events but not others. It would split {\ttfamily text}, {\ttfamily cdata} and {\ttfamily script} events. However, if a {\ttfamily comment}, {\ttfamily doctype}, {\ttfamily attribute} or {\ttfamily processing instruction} were more than the limit, the parser would generate an error and you were left picking up the pieces.

It was not intuitive to use. You\textquotesingle{}d think setting the limit to 1K would prevent chunks bigger than 1K to be passed to event handlers. But that was not the case. A comment in the source code told you that you might go over the limit if you passed large chunks to {\ttfamily write}. So if you want a 1K limit, don\textquotesingle{}t pass 64K chunks to {\ttfamily write}. Fair enough. You know what limit you want so you can control the size of the data you pass to {\ttfamily write}. So you limit the chunks to {\ttfamily write} to 1K at a time. Even if you do this, your event handlers may get data chunks that are 2K in size. Suppose on the previous {\ttfamily write} the parser has just finished processing an open tag, so it is ready for text. Your {\ttfamily write} passes 1K of text. You are not above the limit yet, so no event is generated yet. The next {\ttfamily write} passes another 1K of text. It so happens that sax checks buffer limits only once per {\ttfamily write}, after the chunk of data has been processed. Now you\textquotesingle{}ve hit the limit and you get a {\ttfamily text} event with 2K of data. So even if you limit your {\ttfamily write} calls to the buffer limit you\textquotesingle{}ve set, you may still get events with chunks at twice the buffer size limit you\textquotesingle{}ve specified.

We may consider reinstating an equivalent functionality, provided that it addresses the issues above and does not cause a huge performance drop for use-\/case scenarios that don\textquotesingle{}t need it.
