Encode \& decode HTML \& XML entities with ease \& speed.\hypertarget{readme.md_autotoc_md12451}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Features}{Features}}\label{readme.md_autotoc_md12451}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item üòá Tried and true\+: {\ttfamily entities} is used by many popular libraries; eg. \href{https://github.com/fb55/htmlparser2}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily htmlparser2}}}, the official \href{https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3}{\texttt{ AWS SDK}} and \href{https://github.com/commonmark/commonmark.js}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily commonmark}}} use it to process HTML entities.
\item ‚ö°Ô∏è Fast\+: {\ttfamily entities} is the fastest library for decoding HTML entities (as of April 2022); see performance.
\item üéõ Configurable\+: Get an output tailored for your needs. You are fine with UTF8? That\textquotesingle{}ll save you some bytes. Prefer to only have ASCII characters? We can do that as well!

This is how {\ttfamily entities} compares to other libraries on a very basic benchmark (see {\ttfamily scripts/benchmark.\+ts}, for 10,000,000 iterations; {\bfseries{lower is better}})\+:

\begin{quote}
What methods should I actually use to encode my documents? \end{quote}


If your target supports UTF-\/8, the {\ttfamily escape\+UTF8} method is going to be your best choice. Otherwise, use either {\ttfamily encode\+HTML} or {\ttfamily encode\+XML} based on whether you\textquotesingle{}re dealing with an HTML or an XML document.

You can have a look at the options for the {\ttfamily encode} and {\ttfamily decode} methods to see everything you can configure.

\begin{quote}
When should I use strict decoding? \end{quote}


When strict decoding, entities not terminated with a semicolon will be ignored. This is helpful for decoding entities in legacy environments.

\begin{quote}
Why should I use {\ttfamily entities} instead of alternative modules? \end{quote}


As of April 2022, {\ttfamily entities} is a bit faster than other modules. Still, this is not a very differentiated space and other modules can catch up.

{\bfseries{More importantly}}, you might already have {\ttfamily entities} in your dependency graph (as a dependency of eg. {\ttfamily cheerio}, or {\ttfamily htmlparser2}), and including it directly might not even increase your bundle size. The same is true for other entity libraries, so have a look through your {\ttfamily node\+\_\+modules} directory!

\begin{quote}
Does {\ttfamily entities} support tree shaking? \end{quote}


Yes! {\ttfamily entities} ships as both a Common\+JS and a ES module. Note that for best results, you should not use the {\ttfamily encode} and {\ttfamily decode} functions, as they wrap around a number of other functions, all of which will remain in the bundle. Instead, use the functions that you need directly.

This library wouldn\textquotesingle{}t be possible without the work of these individuals. Thanks to


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{https://github.com/mathiasbynens}{\texttt{ @mathiasbynens}} for his explanations about character encodings, and his library {\ttfamily he}, which was one of the inspirations for {\ttfamily entities}
\item \href{https://github.com/inikulin}{\texttt{ @inikulin}} for his work on optimized tries for decoding HTML entities for the {\ttfamily parse5} project
\item \href{https://github.com/mdevils}{\texttt{ @mdevils}} for taking on the challenge of producing a quick entity library with his {\ttfamily html-\/entities} library. {\ttfamily entities} would be quite a bit slower if there wasn\textquotesingle{}t any competition. Right now {\ttfamily entities} is on top, but we\textquotesingle{}ll see how long that lasts!
