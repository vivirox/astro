Node has issues when using spawn on Windows\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item It ignores \href{https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/2318}{\texttt{ PATHEXT}}
\item It does not support \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)}{\texttt{ shebangs}}
\item Has problems running commands with \href{https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/7367}{\texttt{ spaces}}
\item Has problems running commands with posix relative paths (e.\+g.\+: {\ttfamily ./my-\/folder/my-\/executable})
\item Has an \href{https://github.com/moxystudio/node-cross-spawn/issues/82}{\texttt{ issue}} with command shims (files in {\ttfamily node\+\_\+modules/.bin/}), where arguments with quotes and parenthesis would result in \href{https://github.com/moxystudio/node-cross-spawn/blob/e77b8f22a416db46b6196767bcd35601d7e11d54/test/index.test.js\#L149}{\texttt{ invalid syntax error}}
\item No {\ttfamily options.\+shell} support on node {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}v4.\+8}
\end{DoxyItemize}

All these issues are handled correctly by {\ttfamily cross-\/spawn}. There are some known modules, such as \href{https://github.com/ForbesLindesay/win-spawn}{\texttt{ win-\/spawn}}, that try to solve this but they are either broken or provide faulty escaping of shell arguments.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md11069}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Usage}{Usage}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md11069}
Exactly the same way as node\textquotesingle{}s \href{https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html\#child_process_child_process_spawn_command_args_options}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily spawn}}} or \href{https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html\#child_process_child_process_spawnsync_command_args_options}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily spawn\+Sync}}}, so it\textquotesingle{}s a drop in replacement.

Starting from node {\ttfamily v4.\+8}, {\ttfamily spawn} has a {\ttfamily shell} option that allows you run commands from within a shell. This new option solves the \href{https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/2318}{\texttt{ PATHEXT}} issue but\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item It\textquotesingle{}s not supported in node {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}v4.\+8}
\item You must manually escape the command and arguments which is very error prone, specially when passing user input
\item There are a lot of other unresolved issues from the Why section that you must take into account
\end{DoxyItemize}

If you are using the {\ttfamily shell} option to spawn a command in a cross platform way, consider using {\ttfamily cross-\/spawn} instead. You have been warned.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md11072}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{{\ttfamily options.\+shell} support}{{\ttfamily options.\+shell} support}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md11072}
While {\ttfamily cross-\/spawn} adds support for {\ttfamily options.\+shell} in node {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}v4.\+8}, all of its enhancements are disabled.

This mimics the Node.\+js behavior. More specifically, the command and its arguments will not be automatically escaped nor shebang support will be offered. This is by design because if you are using {\ttfamily options.\+shell} you are probably targeting a specific platform anyway and you don\textquotesingle{}t want things to get into your way.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md11073}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Shebangs support}{Shebangs support}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md11073}
While {\ttfamily cross-\/spawn} handles shebangs on Windows, its support is limited. More specifically, it just supports {\ttfamily \#!/usr/bin/env \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}program\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}} where {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}program\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}} must not contain any arguments. ~\newline
 If you would like to have the shebang support improved, feel free to contribute via a pull-\/request.
