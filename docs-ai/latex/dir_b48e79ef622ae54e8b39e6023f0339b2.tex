\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This is the code that turns all the raw text from postgres into Java\+Script types for \href{https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres.git}{\texttt{ node-\/postgres}}\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md25910}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{use}{use}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md25910}
This module is consumed and exported from the root {\ttfamily pg} object of node-\/postgres. To access it, do the following\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{var\ types\ =\ require('pg').types}

\end{DoxyCode}


Generally what you\textquotesingle{}ll want to do is override how a specific data-\/type is parsed and turned into a Java\+Script type. By default the Postgre\+SQL backend server returns everything as strings. Every data type corresponds to a unique {\ttfamily OID} within the server, and these {\ttfamily OIDs} are sent back with the query response. So, you need to match a particluar {\ttfamily OID} to a function you\textquotesingle{}d like to use to take the raw text input and produce a valid Java\+Script object as a result. {\ttfamily null} values are never parsed.

Let\textquotesingle{}s do something I commonly like to do on projects\+: return 64-\/bit integers {\ttfamily (int8)} as Java\+Script integers. Because Java\+Script doesn\textquotesingle{}t have support for 64-\/bit integers node-\/postgres cannot confidently parse {\ttfamily int8} data type results as numbers because if you have a {\itshape huge} number it will overflow and the result you\textquotesingle{}d get back from node-\/postgres would not be the result in the database. That would be a {\bfseries{very bad thing}} so node-\/postgres just returns {\ttfamily int8} results as strings and leaves the parsing up to you. Let\textquotesingle{}s say that you know you don\textquotesingle{}t and wont ever have numbers greater than {\ttfamily int4} in your database, but you\textquotesingle{}re tired of receiving results from the {\ttfamily COUNT(\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*})} function as strings (because that function returns {\ttfamily int8}). You would do this\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{var\ types\ =\ require('pg').types}
\DoxyCodeLine{types.setTypeParser(20,\ function(val)\ \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ return\ parseInt(val,\ 10)}
\DoxyCodeLine{\})}

\end{DoxyCode}


{\bfseries{boom}}\+: now you get numbers instead of strings.

Just as another example -- not saying this is a good idea -- let\textquotesingle{}s say you want to return all dates from your database as \href{http://momentjs.com/docs/}{\texttt{ moment}} objects. Okay, do this\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{var\ types\ =\ require('pg').types}
\DoxyCodeLine{var\ moment\ =\ require('moment')}
\DoxyCodeLine{var\ parseFn\ =\ function(val)\ \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ return\ val\ ===\ null\ ?\ null\ :\ moment(val)}
\DoxyCodeLine{\}}
\DoxyCodeLine{types.setTypeParser(types.builtins.TIMESTAMPTZ,\ parseFn)}
\DoxyCodeLine{types.setTypeParser(types.builtins.TIMESTAMP,\ parseFn)}

\end{DoxyCode}
 {\itshape note\+: I\textquotesingle{}ve never done that with my dates, and I\textquotesingle{}m not 100\% sure moment can parse all the date strings returned from postgres. It\textquotesingle{}s just an example!}

If you\textquotesingle{}re thinking "{}gee, this seems pretty handy, but how can I get a list of all the OIDs in the database and what they correspond to?!?!?!"{} worry not\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$\ psql\ -\/c\ "{}select\ typname,\ oid,\ typarray\ from\ pg\_type\ order\ by\ oid"{}}

\end{DoxyCode}


If you want to find out the OID of a specific type\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$\ psql\ -\/c\ "{}select\ typname,\ oid,\ typarray\ from\ pg\_type\ where\ typname\ =\ 'daterange'\ order\ by\ oid"{}}

\end{DoxyCode}
