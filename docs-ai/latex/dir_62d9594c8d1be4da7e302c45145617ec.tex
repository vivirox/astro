\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Sometimes you want to load the {\ttfamily package.\+json} into your Type\+Script program, and it\textquotesingle{}s tempting to just `import '../package.json\textquotesingle{}\`{}, since that seems to work.

However, this requires {\ttfamily tsc} to make an entire copy of your {\ttfamily package.\+json} file into the {\ttfamily dist} folder, which is a problem if you\textquotesingle{}re using something like \href{https://github.com/isaacs/tshy}{\texttt{ tshy}}, which uses the {\ttfamily package.\+json} file in dist for another purpose. Even when that does work, it\textquotesingle{}s asking the module system to do a bunch of extra fs system calls, just to load a version number or something. (See \href{https://github.com/isaacs/tshy/issues/61}{\texttt{ this issue}}.)

This module helps by just finding the package.\+json file appropriately, and reading and parsing it in the most normal fashion.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md25486}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Caveats}{Caveats}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md25486}
This {\itshape only} works if your code builds into a target folder called {\ttfamily dist}, which is in the root of the package. It also requires that you do not have a folder named {\ttfamily node\+\_\+modules} anywhere within your dev environment, or else it\textquotesingle{}ll get the wrong answers there. (But, at least, that\textquotesingle{}ll be in dev, so you\textquotesingle{}re pretty likely to notice.)

If you build to some other location, then you\textquotesingle{}ll need a different approach. (Feel free to fork this module and make it your own, or just put the code right inline, there\textquotesingle{}s not much of it.)\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md25487}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{USAGE}{USAGE}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md25487}

If your module is not directly in the {\ttfamily ./src} folder, then you need to specify the path that you would expect to find the {\ttfamily package.\+json} when it\textquotesingle{}s {\itshape not} built to the {\ttfamily dist} folder.

When running from Commmon\+JS, use {\ttfamily \+\_\+\+\_\+filename} instead of {\ttfamily import.\+meta.\+url}.

Since \href{https://github.com/isaacs/tshy}{\texttt{ tshy}} builds {\itshape both} Common\+JS and ESM by default, you may find that you need a Common\+JS override and some {\ttfamily //@ts-\/ignore} magic to make it work.
