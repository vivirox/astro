\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This package implements, in Java\+Script, the algorithms to convert a given Java\+Script value according to a given \href{http://heycam.github.io/webidl/}{\texttt{ Web\+IDL}} \href{http://heycam.github.io/webidl/\#idl-types}{\texttt{ type}}.

The goal is that you should be able to write code like


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{const\ conversions\ =\ require("{}webidl-\/conversions"{});}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{function\ doStuff(x,\ y)\ \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ x\ =\ conversions["{}boolean"{}](x);}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ y\ =\ conversions["{}unsigned\ long"{}](y);}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ //\ actual\ algorithm\ code\ here}
\DoxyCodeLine{\}}

\end{DoxyCode}


and your function {\ttfamily do\+Stuff} will behave the same as a Web\+IDL operation declared as


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{void\ doStuff(boolean\ x,\ unsigned\ long\ y);}

\end{DoxyCode}

This package\textquotesingle{}s main module\textquotesingle{}s default export is an object with a variety of methods, each corresponding to a different Web\+IDL type. Each method, when invoked on a Java\+Script value, will give back the new Java\+Script value that results after passing through the Web\+IDL conversion rules. (See below for more details on what that means.) Alternately, the method could throw an error, if the Web\+IDL algorithm is specified to do so\+: for example {\ttfamily conversions\mbox{[}"{}float"{}\mbox{]}(NaN)} \href{http://heycam.github.io/webidl/\#es-float}{\texttt{ will throw a {\ttfamily Type\+Error}}}.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md35526}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Status}{Status}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md35526}
All of the numeric types are implemented (float being implemented as double) and some others are as well -\/ check the source for all of them. This list will grow over time in service of the \href{https://github.com/dglazkov/html-as-custom-elements}{\texttt{ HTML as Custom Elements}} project, but in the meantime, pull requests welcome!

I\textquotesingle{}m not sure yet what the strategy will be for modifiers, e.\+g. \href{http://heycam.github.io/webidl/\#Clamp}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily \mbox{[}Clamp\mbox{]}}}}. Maybe something like {\ttfamily conversions\mbox{[}"{}unsigned long"{}\mbox{]}(x, \{ clamp\+: true \})}? We\textquotesingle{}ll see.

We might also want to extend the API to give better error messages, e.\+g. "{}\+Argument 1 of HTMLMedia\+Element.\+fast\+Seek is not a finite floating-\/point value"{} instead of "{}\+Argument is not a finite floating-\/point value."{} This would require passing in more information to the conversion functions than we currently do.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md35527}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Background}{Background}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md35527}
What\textquotesingle{}s actually going on here, conceptually, is pretty weird. Let\textquotesingle{}s try to explain.

Web\+IDL, as part of its madness-\/inducing design, has its own type system. When people write algorithms in web platform specs, they usually operate on Web\+IDL values, i.\+e. instances of Web\+IDL types. For example, if they were specifying the algorithm for our {\ttfamily do\+Stuff} operation above, they would treat {\ttfamily x} as a Web\+IDL value of \href{http://heycam.github.io/webidl/\#idl-boolean}{\texttt{ Web\+IDL type {\ttfamily boolean}}}. Crucially, they would {\itshape not} treat {\ttfamily x} as a Java\+Script variable whose value is either the Java\+Script {\ttfamily true} or {\ttfamily false}. They\textquotesingle{}re instead working in a different type system altogether, with its own rules.

Separately from its type system, Web\+IDL defines a \href{http://heycam.github.io/webidl/\#ecmascript-binding}{\texttt{ "{}binding"{}}} of the type system into Java\+Script. This contains rules like\+: when you pass a Java\+Script value to the Java\+Script method that manifests a given Web\+IDL operation, how does that get converted into a Web\+IDL value? For example, a Java\+Script {\ttfamily true} passed in the position of a Web\+IDL {\ttfamily boolean} argument becomes a Web\+IDL {\ttfamily true}. But, a Java\+Script {\ttfamily true} passed in the position of a \href{http://heycam.github.io/webidl/\#idl-unsigned-long}{\texttt{ Web\+IDL {\ttfamily unsigned long}}} becomes a Web\+IDL {\ttfamily 1}. And so on.

Finally, we have the actual implementation code. This is usually C++, although these days \href{https://github.com/servo/servo}{\texttt{ some smart people are using Rust}}. The implementation, of course, has its own type system. So when they implement the Web\+IDL algorithms, they don\textquotesingle{}t actually use Web\+IDL values, since those aren\textquotesingle{}t "{}real"{} outside of specs. Instead, implementations apply the Web\+IDL binding rules in such a way as to convert incoming Java\+Script values into C++ values. For example, if code in the browser called {\ttfamily do\+Stuff(true, true)}, then the implementation code would eventually receive a C++ {\ttfamily bool} containing {\ttfamily true} and a C++ {\ttfamily uint32\+\_\+t} containing {\ttfamily 1}.

The upside of all this is that implementations can abstract all the conversion logic away, letting Web\+IDL handle it, and focus on implementing the relevant methods in C++ with values of the correct type already provided. That is payoff of Web\+IDL, in a nutshell.

And getting to that payoff is the goal of {\itshape this} project—but for Java\+Script implementations, instead of C++ ones. That is, this library is designed to make it easier for Java\+Script developers to write functions that behave like a given Web\+IDL operation. So conceptually, the conversion pipeline, which in its general form is Java\+Script values ↦ Web\+IDL values ↦ implementation-\/language values, in this case becomes Java\+Script values ↦ Web\+IDL values ↦ Java\+Script values. And that intermediate step is where all the logic is performed\+: a Java\+Script {\ttfamily true} becomes a Web\+IDL {\ttfamily 1} in an unsigned long context, which then becomes a Java\+Script {\ttfamily 1}.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md35528}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Don\textquotesingle{}t Use This}{Don\textquotesingle{}t Use This}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md35528}
Seriously, why would you ever use this? You really shouldn\textquotesingle{}t. Web\+IDL is … not great, and you shouldn\textquotesingle{}t be emulating its semantics. If you\textquotesingle{}re looking for a generic argument-\/processing library, you should find one with better rules than those from Web\+IDL. In general, your Java\+Script should not be trying to become more like Web\+IDL; if anything, we should fix Web\+IDL to make it more like Java\+Script.

The {\itshape only} people who should use this are those trying to create faithful implementations (or polyfills) of web platform interfaces defined in Web\+IDL.
