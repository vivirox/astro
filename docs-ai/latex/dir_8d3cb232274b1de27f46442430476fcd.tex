 jsdom }

jsdom is a pure-\/\+Java\+Script implementation of many web standards, notably the WHATWG \href{https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/}{\texttt{ DOM}} and \href{https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/}{\texttt{ HTML}} Standards, for use with Node.\+js. In general, the goal of the project is to emulate enough of a subset of a web browser to be useful for testing and scraping real-\/world web applications.

The latest versions of jsdom require Node.\+js v18 or newer. (Versions of jsdom below v23 still work with previous Node.\+js versions, but are unsupported.)\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md21013}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Basic usage}{Basic usage}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md21013}

\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{const\ jsdom\ =\ require("{}jsdom"{});}
\DoxyCodeLine{const\ \{\ JSDOM\ \}\ =\ jsdom;}

\end{DoxyCode}


To use jsdom, you will primarily use the {\ttfamily JSDOM} constructor, which is a named export of the jsdom main module. Pass the constructor a string. You will get back a {\ttfamily JSDOM} object, which has a number of useful properties, notably {\ttfamily window}\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{const\ dom\ =\ new\ JSDOM(`<!DOCTYPE\ html><p>Hello\ world</p>`);}
\DoxyCodeLine{console.log(dom.window.document.querySelector("{}p"{}).textContent);\ //\ "{}Hello\ world"{}}

\end{DoxyCode}


(Note that jsdom will parse the HTML you pass it just like a browser does, including implied {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}html\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}}, {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}head\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}}, and {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}body\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}} tags.)

The resulting object is an instance of the {\ttfamily JSDOM} class, which contains a number of useful properties and methods besides {\ttfamily window}. In general, it can be used to act on the jsdom from the "{}outside,"{} doing things that are not possible with the normal DOM APIs. For simple cases, where you don\textquotesingle{}t need any of this functionality, we recommend a coding pattern like


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{const\ \{\ window\ \}\ =\ new\ JSDOM(`...`);}
\DoxyCodeLine{//\ or\ even}
\DoxyCodeLine{const\ \{\ document\ \}\ =\ (new\ JSDOM(`...`)).window;}

\end{DoxyCode}


Full documentation on everything you can do with the {\ttfamily JSDOM} class is below, in the section "{}\`{}\+JSDOM\`{} Object API"{}.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md21014}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Customizing jsdom}{Customizing jsdom}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md21014}
The {\ttfamily JSDOM} constructor accepts a second parameter which can be used to customize your jsdom in the following ways.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md21015}{}\doxysubsubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Simple options}{Simple options}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md21015}

\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{const\ dom\ =\ new\ JSDOM(``,\ \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ url:\ "{}https://example.org/"{},}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ referrer:\ "{}https://example.com/"{},}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ contentType:\ "{}text/html"{},}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ includeNodeLocations:\ true,}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ storageQuota:\ 10000000}
\DoxyCodeLine{\});}

\end{DoxyCode}



\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily url} sets the value returned by {\ttfamily window.\+location}, {\ttfamily document.\+URL}, and {\ttfamily document.\+document\+URI}, and affects things like resolution of relative URLs within the document and the same-\/origin restrictions and referrer used while fetching subresources. It defaults to {\ttfamily "{}about\+:blank"{}}.
\item {\ttfamily referrer} just affects the value read from {\ttfamily document.\+referrer}. It defaults to no referrer (which reflects as the empty string).
\item {\ttfamily content\+Type} affects the value read from {\ttfamily document.\+content\+Type}, as well as how the document is parsed\+: as HTML or as XML. Values that are not a \href{https://mimesniff.spec.whatwg.org/\#html-mime-type}{\texttt{ HTML MIME type}} or an \href{https://mimesniff.spec.whatwg.org/\#xml-mime-type}{\texttt{ XML MIME type}} will throw. It defaults to {\ttfamily "{}text/html"{}}. If a {\ttfamily charset} parameter is present, it can affect binary data processing.
\item {\ttfamily include\+Node\+Locations} preserves the location info produced by the HTML parser, allowing you to retrieve it with the {\ttfamily node\+Location()} method (described below). It also ensures that line numbers reported in exception stack traces for code running inside {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}script\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}} elements are correct. It defaults to {\ttfamily false} to give the best performance, and cannot be used with an XML content type since our XML parser does not support location info.
\item {\ttfamily storage\+Quota} is the maximum size in code units for the separate storage areas used by {\ttfamily local\+Storage} and {\ttfamily session\+Storage}. Attempts to store data larger than this limit will cause a {\ttfamily DOMException} to be thrown. By default, it is set to 5,000,000 code units per origin, as inspired by the HTML specification.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Note that both {\ttfamily url} and {\ttfamily referrer} are canonicalized before they\textquotesingle{}re used, so e.\+g. if you pass in {\ttfamily "{}https\+:example.\+com"{}}, jsdom will interpret that as if you had given {\ttfamily "{}https\+://example.\+com/"{}}. If you pass an unparseable URL, the call will throw. (URLs are parsed and serialized according to the \href{https://url.spec.whatwg.org/}{\texttt{ URL Standard}}.)\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md21016}{}\doxysubsubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Executing scripts}{Executing scripts}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md21016}
jsdom\textquotesingle{}s most powerful ability is that it can execute scripts inside the jsdom. These scripts can modify the content of the page and access all the web platform APIs jsdom implements.

However, this is also highly dangerous when dealing with untrusted content. The jsdom sandbox is not foolproof, and code running inside the DOM\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}script\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}}s can, if it tries hard enough, get access to the Node.\+js environment, and thus to your machine. As such, the ability to execute scripts embedded in the HTML is disabled by default\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{const\ dom\ =\ new\ JSDOM(`<body>}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ <div\ id="{}content"{}></div>}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ <script>document.getElementById("{}content"{}).append(document.createElement("{}hr"{}));</script>}
\DoxyCodeLine{</body>`);}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{//\ The\ script\ will\ not\ be\ executed,\ by\ default:}
\DoxyCodeLine{console.log(dom.window.document.getElementById("{}content"{}).children.length);\ //\ 0}

\end{DoxyCode}


To enable executing scripts inside the page, you can use the {\ttfamily run\+Scripts\+: "{}dangerously"{}} option\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{const\ dom\ =\ new\ JSDOM(`<body>}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ <div\ id="{}content"{}></div>}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ <script>document.getElementById("{}content"{}).append(document.createElement("{}hr"{}));</script>}
\DoxyCodeLine{</body>`,\ \{\ runScripts:\ "{}dangerously"{}\ \});}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{//\ The\ script\ will\ be\ executed\ and\ modify\ the\ DOM:}
\DoxyCodeLine{console.log(dom.window.document.getElementById("{}content"{}).children.length);\ //\ 1}

\end{DoxyCode}


Again we emphasize to only use this when feeding jsdom code you know is safe. If you use it on arbitrary user-\/supplied code, or code from the Internet, you are effectively running untrusted Node.\+js code, and your machine could be compromised.

If you want to execute {\itshape external} scripts, included via {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}script src="{}"{}\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}}, you\textquotesingle{}ll also need to ensure that they load them. To do this, add the option {\ttfamily resources\+: "{}usable"{}} as described below. (You\textquotesingle{}ll likely also want to set the {\ttfamily url} option, for the reasons discussed there.)

Event handler attributes, like {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}div onclick="{}"{}\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}}, are also governed by this setting; they will not function unless {\ttfamily run\+Scripts} is set to {\ttfamily "{}dangerously"{}}. (However, event handler {\itshape properties}, like {\ttfamily div.\+onclick = ...}, will function regardless of {\ttfamily run\+Scripts}.)

If you are simply trying to execute script "{}from the outside"{}, instead of letting {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}script\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}} elements and event handlers attributes run "{}from the inside"{}, you can use the {\ttfamily run\+Scripts\+: "{}outside-\/only"{}} option, which enables fresh copies of all the Java\+Script spec-\/provided globals to be installed on {\ttfamily window}. This includes things like {\ttfamily window.\+Array}, {\ttfamily window.\+Promise}, etc. It also, notably, includes {\ttfamily window.\+eval}, which allows running scripts, but with the jsdom {\ttfamily window} as the global\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{const\ dom\ =\ new\ JSDOM(`<body>}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ <div\ id="{}content"{}></div>}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ <script>document.getElementById("{}content"{}).append(document.createElement("{}hr"{}));</script>}
\DoxyCodeLine{</body>`,\ \{\ runScripts:\ "{}outside-\/only"{}\ \});}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{//\ run\ a\ script\ outside\ of\ JSDOM:}
\DoxyCodeLine{dom.window.eval('document.getElementById("{}content"{}).append(document.createElement("{}p"{}));');}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{console.log(dom.window.document.getElementById("{}content"{}).children.length);\ //\ 1}
\DoxyCodeLine{console.log(dom.window.document.getElementsByTagName("{}hr"{}).length);\ //\ 0}
\DoxyCodeLine{console.log(dom.window.document.getElementsByTagName("{}p"{}).length);\ //\ 1}

\end{DoxyCode}


This is turned off by default for performance reasons, but is safe to enable.

Note that in the default configuration, without setting {\ttfamily run\+Scripts}, the values of {\ttfamily window.\+Array}, {\ttfamily window.\+eval}, etc. will be the same as those provided by the outer Node.\+js environment. That is, {\ttfamily window.\+eval === eval} will hold, so {\ttfamily window.\+eval} will not run scripts in a useful way.

We strongly advise against trying to "{}execute scripts"{} by mashing together the jsdom and Node global environments (e.\+g. by doing {\ttfamily global.\+window = dom.\+window}), and then executing scripts or test code inside the Node global environment. Instead, you should treat jsdom like you would a browser, and run all scripts and tests that need access to a DOM inside the jsdom environment, using {\ttfamily window.\+eval} or {\ttfamily run\+Scripts\+: "{}dangerously"{}}. This might require, for example, creating a browserify bundle to execute as a {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}script\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}} element—just like you would in a browser.

Finally, for advanced use cases you can use the {\ttfamily dom.\+get\+Internal\+VMContext()} method, documented below.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md21017}{}\doxysubsubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Pretending to be a visual browser}{Pretending to be a visual browser}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md21017}
jsdom does not have the capability to render visual content, and will act like a headless browser by default. It provides hints to web pages through APIs such as {\ttfamily document.\+hidden} that their content is not visible.

When the {\ttfamily pretend\+To\+Be\+Visual} option is set to {\ttfamily true}, jsdom will pretend that it is rendering and displaying content. It does this by\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Changing {\ttfamily document.\+hidden} to return {\ttfamily false} instead of {\ttfamily true}
\item Changing {\ttfamily document.\+visibility\+State} to return {\ttfamily "{}visible"{}} instead of {\ttfamily "{}prerender"{}}
\item Enabling {\ttfamily window.\+request\+Animation\+Frame()} and {\ttfamily window.\+cancel\+Animation\+Frame()} methods, which otherwise do not exist
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{const\ window\ =\ (new\ JSDOM(``,\ \{\ pretendToBeVisual:\ true\ \})).window;}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{window.requestAnimationFrame(timestamp\ =>\ \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ console.log(timestamp\ >\ 0);}
\DoxyCodeLine{\});}

\end{DoxyCode}


Note that jsdom still does not do any layout or rendering, so this is really just about {\itshape pretending} to be visual, not about implementing the parts of the platform a real, visual web browser would implement.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md21018}{}\doxysubsubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Loading subresources}{Loading subresources}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md21018}
\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md21019}{}\doxysubsubsubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Basic options}{Basic options}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md21019}
By default, jsdom will not load any subresources such as scripts, stylesheets, images, or iframes. If you\textquotesingle{}d like jsdom to load such resources, you can pass the {\ttfamily resources\+: "{}usable"{}} option, which will load all usable resources. Those are\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Frames and iframes, via {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}frame\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}} and {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}iframe\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}}
\item Stylesheets, via {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}link rel="{}stylesheet"{}\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}}
\item Scripts, via {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}script\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}}, but only if {\ttfamily run\+Scripts\+: "{}dangerously"{}} is also set
\item Images, via {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}img\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}}, but only if the {\ttfamily canvas} npm package is also installed (see "{}\mbox{[}\+Canvas Support\mbox{]}(\#canvas-\/support)"{} below)
\end{DoxyItemize}

When attempting to load resources, recall that the default value for the {\ttfamily url} option is {\ttfamily "{}about\+:blank"{}}, which means that any resources included via relative URLs will fail to load. (The result of trying to parse the URL {\ttfamily /something} against the URL {\ttfamily about\+:blank} is an error.) So, you\textquotesingle{}ll likely want to set a non-\/default value for the {\ttfamily url} option in those cases, or use one of the convenience APIs that do so automatically.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md21020}{}\doxysubsubsubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Advanced configuration}{Advanced configuration}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md21020}
To more fully customize jsdom\textquotesingle{}s resource-\/loading behavior, you can pass an instance of the {\ttfamily Resource\+Loader} class as the {\ttfamily resources} option value\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{const\ resourceLoader\ =\ new\ jsdom.ResourceLoader(\{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ proxy:\ "{}http://127.0.0.1:9001"{},}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ strictSSL:\ false,}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ userAgent:\ "{}Mellblomenator/9000"{},}
\DoxyCodeLine{\});}
\DoxyCodeLine{const\ dom\ =\ new\ JSDOM(``,\ \{\ resources:\ resourceLoader\ \});}

\end{DoxyCode}


The three options to the {\ttfamily Resource\+Loader} constructor are\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily proxy} is the address of an HTTP proxy to be used.
\item {\ttfamily strict\+SSL} can be set to false to disable the requirement that SSL certificates be valid.
\item {\ttfamily user\+Agent} affects the {\ttfamily User-\/\+Agent} header sent, and thus the resulting value for {\ttfamily navigator.\+user\+Agent}. It defaults to {\ttfamily \`{}\+Mozilla/5.0 (\$\{process.\+platform \texorpdfstring{$\vert$}{|}\texorpdfstring{$\vert$}{|} "{}unknown OS"{}\}) Apple\+Web\+Kit/537.\+36 (KHTML, like Gecko) jsdom/\$\{jsdom\+Version\}\`{}}.
\end{DoxyItemize}

You can further customize resource fetching by subclassing {\ttfamily Resource\+Loader} and overriding the {\ttfamily fetch()} method. For example, here is a version that overrides the response provided for a specific URL\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{class\ CustomResourceLoader\ extends\ jsdom.ResourceLoader\ \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ fetch(url,\ options)\ \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ //\ Override\ the\ contents\ of\ this\ script\ to\ do\ something\ unusual.}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ if\ (url\ ===\ "{}https://example.com/some-\/specific-\/script.js"{})\ \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ \ \ return\ Promise.resolve(Buffer.from("{}window.someGlobal\ =\ 5;"{}));}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ \}}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ return\ super.fetch(url,\ options);}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\}}

\end{DoxyCode}


jsdom will call your custom resource loader\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily fetch()} method whenever it encounters a "{}usable"{} resource, per the above section. The method takes a URL string, as well as a few options which you should pass through unmodified if calling {\ttfamily super.\+fetch()}. It must return a promise for a Node.\+js {\ttfamily Buffer} object, or return {\ttfamily null} if the resource is intentionally not to be loaded. In general, most cases will want to delegate to {\ttfamily super.\+fetch()}, as shown.

One of the options you will receive in {\ttfamily fetch()} will be the element (if applicable) that is fetching a resource.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{class\ CustomResourceLoader\ extends\ jsdom.ResourceLoader\ \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ fetch(url,\ options)\ \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ if\ (options.element)\ \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ \ \ console.log(`Element\ \$\{options.element.localName\}\ is\ requesting\ the\ url\ \$\{url\}`);}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ \}}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ return\ super.fetch(url,\ options);}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\}}

\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md21021}{}\doxysubsubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Virtual consoles}{Virtual consoles}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md21021}
Like web browsers, jsdom has the concept of a "{}console"{}. This records both information directly sent from the page, via scripts executing inside the document, as well as information from the jsdom implementation itself. We call the user-\/controllable console a "{}virtual console"{}, to distinguish it from the Node.\+js {\ttfamily console} API and from the inside-\/the-\/page {\ttfamily window.\+console} API.

By default, the {\ttfamily JSDOM} constructor will return an instance with a virtual console that forwards all its output to the Node.\+js console. To create your own virtual console and pass it to jsdom, you can override this default by doing


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{const\ virtualConsole\ =\ new\ jsdom.VirtualConsole();}
\DoxyCodeLine{const\ dom\ =\ new\ JSDOM(``,\ \{\ virtualConsole\ \});}

\end{DoxyCode}


Code like this will create a virtual console with no behavior. You can give it behavior by adding event listeners for all the possible console methods\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{virtualConsole.on("{}error"{},\ ()\ =>\ \{\ ...\ \});}
\DoxyCodeLine{virtualConsole.on("{}warn"{},\ ()\ =>\ \{\ ...\ \});}
\DoxyCodeLine{virtualConsole.on("{}info"{},\ ()\ =>\ \{\ ...\ \});}
\DoxyCodeLine{virtualConsole.on("{}dir"{},\ ()\ =>\ \{\ ...\ \});}
\DoxyCodeLine{//\ ...\ etc.\ See\ https://console.spec.whatwg.org/\#logging}

\end{DoxyCode}


(Note that it is probably best to set up these event listeners {\itshape before} calling {\ttfamily new JSDOM()}, since errors or console-\/invoking script might occur during parsing.)

If you simply want to redirect the virtual console output to another console, like the default Node.\+js one, you can do


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{virtualConsole.sendTo(console);}

\end{DoxyCode}


There is also a special event, {\ttfamily "{}jsdom\+Error"{}}, which will fire with error objects to report errors from jsdom itself. This is similar to how error messages often show up in web browser consoles, even if they are not initiated by {\ttfamily console.\+error}. So far, the following errors are output this way\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Errors loading or parsing subresources (scripts, stylesheets, frames, and iframes)
\item Script execution errors that are not handled by a window {\ttfamily onerror} event handler that returns {\ttfamily true} or calls {\ttfamily event.\+prevent\+Default()}
\item Not-\/implemented errors resulting from calls to methods, like {\ttfamily window.\+alert}, which jsdom does not implement, but installs anyway for web compatibility
\end{DoxyItemize}

If you\textquotesingle{}re using {\ttfamily send\+To(c)} to send errors to {\ttfamily c}, by default it will call {\ttfamily c.\+error(error\+Stack\mbox{[}, error\+Detail\mbox{]})} with information from {\ttfamily "{}jsdom\+Error"{}} events. If you\textquotesingle{}d prefer to maintain a strict one-\/to-\/one mapping of events to method calls, and perhaps handle {\ttfamily "{}jsdom\+Error"{}}s yourself, then you can do


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{virtualConsole.sendTo(c,\ \{\ omitJSDOMErrors:\ true\ \});}

\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md21022}{}\doxysubsubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Cookie jars}{Cookie jars}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md21022}
Like web browsers, jsdom has the concept of a cookie jar, storing HTTP cookies. Cookies that have a URL on the same domain as the document, and are not marked HTTP-\/only, are accessible via the {\ttfamily document.\+cookie} API. Additionally, all cookies in the cookie jar will impact the fetching of subresources.

By default, the {\ttfamily JSDOM} constructor will return an instance with an empty cookie jar. To create your own cookie jar and pass it to jsdom, you can override this default by doing


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{const\ cookieJar\ =\ new\ jsdom.CookieJar(store,\ options);}
\DoxyCodeLine{const\ dom\ =\ new\ JSDOM(``,\ \{\ cookieJar\ \});}

\end{DoxyCode}


This is mostly useful if you want to share the same cookie jar among multiple jsdoms, or prime the cookie jar with certain values ahead of time.

Cookie jars are provided by the \href{https://www.npmjs.com/package/tough-cookie}{\texttt{ tough-\/cookie}} package. The {\ttfamily jsdom.\+Cookie\+Jar} constructor is a subclass of the tough-\/cookie cookie jar which by default sets the {\ttfamily loose\+Mode\+: true} option, since that \href{https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/804}{\texttt{ matches better how browsers behave}}. If you want to use tough-\/cookie\textquotesingle{}s utilities and classes yourself, you can use the {\ttfamily jsdom.\+tough\+Cookie} module export to get access to the tough-\/cookie module instance packaged with jsdom.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md21023}{}\doxysubsubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Intervening before parsing}{Intervening before parsing}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md21023}
jsdom allows you to intervene in the creation of a jsdom very early\+: after the {\ttfamily Window} and {\ttfamily Document} objects are created, but before any HTML is parsed to populate the document with nodes\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{const\ dom\ =\ new\ JSDOM(`<p>Hello</p>`,\ \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ beforeParse(window)\ \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ window.document.childNodes.length\ ===\ 0;}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ window.someCoolAPI\ =\ ()\ =>\ \{\ /*\ ...\ */\ \};}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\});}

\end{DoxyCode}


This is especially useful if you are wanting to modify the environment in some way, for example adding shims for web platform APIs jsdom does not support.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md21024}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{{\ttfamily JSDOM} object API}{{\ttfamily JSDOM} object API}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md21024}

The property {\ttfamily window} retrieves the {\ttfamily Window} object that was created for you.

The properties {\ttfamily virtual\+Console} and {\ttfamily cookie\+Jar} reflect the options you pass in, or the defaults created for you if nothing was passed in for those options.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md21026}{}\doxysubsubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Serializing the document with {\ttfamily serialize()}}{Serializing the document with {\ttfamily serialize()}}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md21026}
The {\ttfamily serialize()} method will return the \href{https://html.spec.whatwg.org/\#html-fragment-serialisation-algorithm}{\texttt{ HTML serialization}} of the document, including the doctype\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}

Note that this feature only works if you have set the {\ttfamily include\+Node\+Locations} option; node locations are off by default for performance reasons.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md21028}{}\doxysubsubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Interfacing with the Node.\+js {\ttfamily vm} module using {\ttfamily get\+Internal\+VMContext()}}{Interfacing with the Node.\+js {\ttfamily vm} module using {\ttfamily get\+Internal\+VMContext()}}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md21028}
The built-\/in \href{https://nodejs.org/api/vm.html}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily vm}}} module of Node.\+js is what underpins jsdom\textquotesingle{}s script-\/running magic. Some advanced use cases, like pre-\/compiling a script and then running it multiple times, benefit from using the {\ttfamily vm} module directly with a jsdom-\/created {\ttfamily Window}.

To get access to the \href{https://nodejs.org/api/vm.html\#vm_what_does_it_mean_to_contextify_an_object}{\texttt{ contextified global object}}, suitable for use with the {\ttfamily vm} APIs, you can use the {\ttfamily get\+Internal\+VMContext()} method\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{const\ \{\ Script\ \}\ =\ require("{}vm"{});}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{const\ dom\ =\ new\ JSDOM(``,\ \{\ runScripts:\ "{}outside-\/only"{}\ \});}
\DoxyCodeLine{const\ script\ =\ new\ Script(`}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ if\ (!this.ran)\ \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ this.ran\ =\ 0;}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \}}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ ++this.ran;}
\DoxyCodeLine{\`{});}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{const\ vmContext\ =\ dom.getInternalVMContext();}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{script.runInContext(vmContext);}
\DoxyCodeLine{script.runInContext(vmContext);}
\DoxyCodeLine{script.runInContext(vmContext);}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{console.assert(dom.window.ran\ ===\ 3);}

\end{DoxyCode}


This is somewhat-\/advanced functionality, and we advise sticking to normal DOM APIs (such as {\ttfamily window.\+eval()} or {\ttfamily document.\+create\+Element("{}script"{})}) unless you have very specific needs.

Note that this method will throw an exception if the {\ttfamily JSDOM} instance was created without {\ttfamily run\+Scripts} set, or if you are using jsdom in a web browser.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md21029}{}\doxysubsubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Reconfiguring the jsdom with {\ttfamily reconfigure(settings)}}{Reconfiguring the jsdom with {\ttfamily reconfigure(settings)}}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md21029}
The {\ttfamily top} property on {\ttfamily window} is marked {\ttfamily \mbox{[}Unforgeable\mbox{]}} in the spec, meaning it is a non-\/configurable own property and thus cannot be overridden or shadowed by normal code running inside the jsdom, even using {\ttfamily Object.\+define\+Property}.

Similarly, at present jsdom does not handle navigation (such as setting {\ttfamily window.\+location.\+href = "{}https\+://example.\+com/"{}}); doing so will cause the virtual console to emit a {\ttfamily "{}jsdom\+Error"{}} explaining that this feature is not implemented, and nothing will change\+: there will be no new {\ttfamily Window} or {\ttfamily Document} object, and the existing {\ttfamily window}\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily location} object will still have all the same property values.

However, if you\textquotesingle{}re acting from outside the window, e.\+g. in some test framework that creates jsdoms, you can override one or both of these using the special {\ttfamily reconfigure()} method\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{const\ dom\ =\ new\ JSDOM();}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{dom.window.top\ ===\ dom.window;}
\DoxyCodeLine{dom.window.location.href\ ===\ "{}about:blank"{};}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{dom.reconfigure(\{\ windowTop:\ myFakeTopForTesting,\ url:\ "{}https://example.com/"{}\ \});}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{dom.window.top\ ===\ myFakeTopForTesting;}
\DoxyCodeLine{dom.window.location.href\ ===\ "{}https://example.com/"{};}

\end{DoxyCode}


Note that changing the jsdom\textquotesingle{}s URL will impact all APIs that return the current document URL, such as {\ttfamily window.\+location}, {\ttfamily document.\+URL}, and {\ttfamily document.\+document\+URI}, as well as the resolution of relative URLs within the document, and the same-\/origin checks and referrer used while fetching subresources. It will not, however, perform navigation to the contents of that URL; the contents of the DOM will remain unchanged, and no new instances of {\ttfamily Window}, {\ttfamily Document}, etc. will be created.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md21030}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Convenience APIs}{Convenience APIs}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md21030}
\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md21031}{}\doxysubsubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{{\ttfamily from\+URL()}}{{\ttfamily from\+URL()}}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md21031}
In addition to the {\ttfamily JSDOM} constructor itself, jsdom provides a promise-\/returning factory method for constructing a jsdom from a URL\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{JSDOM.fromURL("{}https://example.com/"{},\ options).then(dom\ =>\ \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ console.log(dom.serialize());}
\DoxyCodeLine{\});}

\end{DoxyCode}


The returned promise will fulfill with a {\ttfamily JSDOM} instance if the URL is valid and the request is successful. Any redirects will be followed to their ultimate destination.

The options provided to {\ttfamily from\+URL()} are similar to those provided to the {\ttfamily JSDOM} constructor, with the following additional restrictions and consequences\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The {\ttfamily url} and {\ttfamily content\+Type} options cannot be provided.
\item The {\ttfamily referrer} option is used as the HTTP {\ttfamily Referer} request header of the initial request.
\item The {\ttfamily resources} option also affects the initial request; this is useful if you want to, for example, configure a proxy (see above).
\item The resulting jsdom\textquotesingle{}s URL, content type, and referrer are determined from the response.
\item Any cookies set via HTTP {\ttfamily Set-\/\+Cookie} response headers are stored in the jsdom\textquotesingle{}s cookie jar. Similarly, any cookies already in a supplied cookie jar are sent as HTTP {\ttfamily Cookie} request headers.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md21032}{}\doxysubsubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{{\ttfamily from\+File()}}{{\ttfamily from\+File()}}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md21032}
Similar to {\ttfamily from\+URL()}, jsdom also provides a {\ttfamily from\+File()} factory method for constructing a jsdom from a filename\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{JSDOM.fromFile("{}stuff.html"{},\ options).then(dom\ =>\ \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ console.log(dom.serialize());}
\DoxyCodeLine{\});}

\end{DoxyCode}


The returned promise will fulfill with a {\ttfamily JSDOM} instance if the given file can be opened. As usual in Node.\+js APIs, the filename is given relative to the current working directory.

The options provided to {\ttfamily from\+File()} are similar to those provided to the {\ttfamily JSDOM} constructor, with the following additional defaults\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The {\ttfamily url} option will default to a file URL corresponding to the given filename, instead of to {\ttfamily "{}about\+:blank"{}}.
\item The {\ttfamily content\+Type} option will default to {\ttfamily "{}application/xhtml+xml"{}} if the given filename ends in {\ttfamily .xht}, {\ttfamily .xhtml}, or {\ttfamily .xml}; otherwise it will continue to default to {\ttfamily "{}text/html"{}}.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md21033}{}\doxysubsubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{{\ttfamily fragment()}}{{\ttfamily fragment()}}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md21033}
For the very simplest of cases, you might not need a whole {\ttfamily JSDOM} instance with all its associated power. You might not even need a {\ttfamily Window} or {\ttfamily Document}! Instead, you just need to parse some HTML, and get a DOM object you can manipulate. For that, we have {\ttfamily fragment()}, which creates a {\ttfamily Document\+Fragment} from a given string\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{const\ frag\ =\ JSDOM.fragment(`<p>Hello</p><p><strong>Hi!</strong>`);}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{frag.childNodes.length\ ===\ 2;}
\DoxyCodeLine{frag.querySelector("{}strong"{}).textContent\ ===\ "{}Hi!"{};}
\DoxyCodeLine{//\ etc.}

\end{DoxyCode}


Here {\ttfamily frag} is a \href{https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DocumentFragment}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily Document\+Fragment}}} instance, whose contents are created by parsing the provided string. The parsing is done using a {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}template\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}} element, so you can include any element there (including ones with weird parsing rules like {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}td\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}}). It\textquotesingle{}s also important to note that the resulting {\ttfamily Document\+Fragment} will not have \href{https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/\#concept-document-bc}{\texttt{ an associated browsing context}}\+: that is, elements\textquotesingle{} {\ttfamily owner\+Document} will have a null {\ttfamily default\+View} property, resources will not load, etc.

All invocations of the {\ttfamily fragment()} factory result in {\ttfamily Document\+Fragment}s that share the same template owner {\ttfamily Document}. This allows many calls to {\ttfamily fragment()} with no extra overhead. But it also means that calls to {\ttfamily fragment()} cannot be customized with any options.

Note that serialization is not as easy with {\ttfamily Document\+Fragment}s as it is with full {\ttfamily JSDOM} objects. If you need to serialize your DOM, you should probably use the {\ttfamily JSDOM} constructor more directly. But for the special case of a fragment containing a single element, it\textquotesingle{}s pretty easy to do through normal means\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{const\ frag\ =\ JSDOM.fragment(`<p>Hello</p>`);}
\DoxyCodeLine{console.log(frag.firstChild.outerHTML);\ //\ logs\ "{}<p>Hello</p>"{}}

\end{DoxyCode}

\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md21035}{}\doxysubsubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Canvas support}{Canvas support}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md21035}
jsdom includes support for using the \href{https://www.npmjs.com/package/canvas}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily canvas}}} package to extend any {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}canvas\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}} elements with the canvas API. To make this work, you need to include {\ttfamily canvas} as a dependency in your project, as a peer of {\ttfamily jsdom}. If jsdom can find the {\ttfamily canvas} package, it will use it, but if it\textquotesingle{}s not present, then {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}canvas\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}} elements will behave like {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}div\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}}s. Since jsdom v13, version 2.\+x of {\ttfamily canvas} is required; version 1.\+x is no longer supported.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md21036}{}\doxysubsubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Encoding sniffing}{Encoding sniffing}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md21036}
In addition to supplying a string, the {\ttfamily JSDOM} constructor can also be supplied binary data, in the form of a Node.\+js \href{https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/buffer.html}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily Buffer}}} or a standard Java\+Script binary data type like {\ttfamily Array\+Buffer}, {\ttfamily Uint8\+Array}, {\ttfamily Data\+View}, etc. When this is done, jsdom will \href{https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html\#encoding-sniffing-algorithm}{\texttt{ sniff the encoding}} from the supplied bytes, scanning for {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}meta charset\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}} tags just like a browser does.

If the supplied {\ttfamily content\+Type} option contains a {\ttfamily charset} parameter, that encoding will override the sniffed encoding—unless a UTF-\/8 or UTF-\/16 BOM is present, in which case those take precedence. (Again, this is just like a browser.)

This encoding sniffing also applies to {\ttfamily JSDOM.\+from\+File()} and {\ttfamily JSDOM.\+from\+URL()}. In the latter case, any {\ttfamily Content-\/\+Type} headers sent with the response will take priority, in the same fashion as the constructor\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily content\+Type} option.

Note that in many cases supplying bytes in this fashion can be better than supplying a string. For example, if you attempt to use Node.\+js\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily buffer.\+to\+String("{}utf-\/8"{})} API, Node.\+js will not strip any leading BOMs. If you then give this string to jsdom, it will interpret it verbatim, leaving the BOM intact. But jsdom\textquotesingle{}s binary data decoding code will strip leading BOMs, just like a browser; in such cases, supplying {\ttfamily buffer} directly will give the desired result.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md21037}{}\doxysubsubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Closing down a jsdom}{Closing down a jsdom}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md21037}
Timers in the jsdom (set by {\ttfamily window.\+set\+Timeout()} or {\ttfamily window.\+set\+Interval()}) will, by definition, execute code in the future in the context of the window. Since there is no way to execute code in the future without keeping the process alive, outstanding jsdom timers will keep your Node.\+js process alive. Similarly, since there is no way to execute code in the context of an object without keeping that object alive, outstanding jsdom timers will prevent garbage collection of the window on which they are scheduled.

If you want to be sure to shut down a jsdom window, use {\ttfamily window.\+close()}, which will terminate all running timers (and also remove any event listeners on the window and document).\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md21038}{}\doxysubsubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Debugging the DOM using Chrome Dev\+Tools}{Debugging the DOM using Chrome Dev\+Tools}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md21038}
In Node.\+js you can debug programs using Chrome Dev\+Tools. See the \href{https://nodejs.org/en/docs/inspector/}{\texttt{ official documentation}} for how to get started.

By default jsdom elements are formatted as plain old JS objects in the console. To make it easier to debug, you can use \href{https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom-devtools-formatter}{\texttt{ jsdom-\/devtools-\/formatter}}, which lets you inspect them like real DOM elements.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md21039}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Caveats}{Caveats}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md21039}
\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md21040}{}\doxysubsubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Asynchronous script loading}{Asynchronous script loading}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md21040}
People often have trouble with asynchronous script loading when using jsdom. Many pages load scripts asynchronously, but there is no way to tell when they\textquotesingle{}re done doing so, and thus when it\textquotesingle{}s a good time to run your code and inspect the resulting DOM structure. This is a fundamental limitation; we cannot predict what scripts on the web page will do, and so cannot tell you when they are done loading more scripts.

This can be worked around in a few ways. The best way, if you control the page in question, is to use whatever mechanisms are given by the script loader to detect when loading is done. For example, if you\textquotesingle{}re using a module loader like Require\+JS, the code could look like\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{//\ On\ the\ Node.js\ side:}
\DoxyCodeLine{const\ window\ =\ (new\ JSDOM(...)).window;}
\DoxyCodeLine{window.onModulesLoaded\ =\ ()\ =>\ \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ console.log("{}ready\ to\ roll!"{});}
\DoxyCodeLine{\};}

\end{DoxyCode}



\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{<!-\/-\/\ Inside\ the\ HTML\ you\ supply\ to\ jsdom\ -\/-\/>}
\DoxyCodeLine{<script>}
\DoxyCodeLine{requirejs(["{}entry-\/module"{}],\ ()\ =>\ \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ window.onModulesLoaded();}
\DoxyCodeLine{\});}
\DoxyCodeLine{</script>}

\end{DoxyCode}


If you do not control the page, you could try workarounds such as polling for the presence of a specific element.

Although we enjoy adding new features to jsdom and keeping it up to date with the latest web specs, it has many missing APIs. Please feel free to file an issue for anything missing, but we\textquotesingle{}re a small and busy team, so a pull request might work even better.

Some features of jsdom are provided by our dependencies. Notable documentation in that regard includes the list of \href{https://github.com/dperini/nwsapi/wiki/CSS-supported-selectors}{\texttt{ supported CSS selectors}} for our CSS selector engine, \href{https://github.com/dperini/nwsapi}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily nwsapi}}}.

Beyond just features that we haven\textquotesingle{}t gotten to yet, there are two major features that are currently outside the scope of jsdom. These are\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Navigation}}\+: the ability to change the global object, and all other objects, when clicking a link or assigning {\ttfamily location.\+href} or similar.
\item {\bfseries{Layout}}\+: the ability to calculate where elements will be visually laid out as a result of CSS, which impacts methods like {\ttfamily get\+Bounding\+Client\+Rects()} or properties like {\ttfamily offset\+Top}.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Currently jsdom has dummy behaviors for some aspects of these features, such as sending a "{}not implemented"{} {\ttfamily "{}jsdom\+Error"{}} to the virtual console for navigation, or returning zeros for many layout-\/related properties. Often you can work around these limitations in your code, e.\+g. by creating new {\ttfamily JSDOM} instances for each page you "{}navigate"{} to during a crawl, or using {\ttfamily Object.\+define\+Property()} to change what various layout-\/related getters and methods return.

Note that other tools in the same space, such as Phantom\+JS, do support these features. On the wiki, we have a more complete writeup about \href{https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom/wiki/jsdom-vs.-PhantomJS}{\texttt{ jsdom vs. Phantom\+JS}}.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md21042}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Supporting jsdom}{Supporting jsdom}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md21042}
