\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
A minimal matching utility.

This is the matching library used internally by npm.

It works by converting glob expressions into Java\+Script {\ttfamily Reg\+Exp} objects.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md16168}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Usage}{Usage}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md16168}

{\bfseries{Please only use forward-\/slashes in glob expressions.}}

Though windows uses either {\ttfamily /} or {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}} as its path separator, only {\ttfamily /} characters are used by this glob implementation. You must use forward-\/slashes {\bfseries{only}} in glob expressions. Back-\/slashes in patterns will always be interpreted as escape characters, not path separators.

Note that {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}} or {\ttfamily /} {\itshape will} be interpreted as path separators in paths on Windows, and will match against {\ttfamily /} in glob expressions.

So just always use {\ttfamily /} in patterns.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md16171}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{UNC Paths}{UNC Paths}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md16171}
On Windows, UNC paths like {\ttfamily //?/c\+:/...} or {\ttfamily //\+Computer\+Name/\+Share/...} are handled specially.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Patterns starting with a double-\/slash followed by some non-\/slash characters will preserve their double-\/slash. As a result, a pattern like {\ttfamily //\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}} will match {\ttfamily //x}, but not {\ttfamily /x}.
\item Patterns staring with {\ttfamily //?/\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}drive letter\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}\+:} will {\itshape not} treat the {\ttfamily ?} as a wildcard character. Instead, it will be treated as a normal string.
\item Patterns starting with {\ttfamily //?/\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}drive letter\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}\+:/...} will match file paths starting with {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}drive letter\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}\+:/...}, and vice versa, as if the {\ttfamily //?/} was not present. This behavior only is present when the drive letters are a case-\/insensitive match to one another. The remaining portions of the path/pattern are compared case sensitively, unless {\ttfamily nocase\+:true} is set.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Note that specifying a UNC path using {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}} characters as path separators is always allowed in the file path argument, but only allowed in the pattern argument when {\ttfamily windows\+Paths\+No\+Escape\+: true} is set in the options.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md16172}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Minimatch Class}{Minimatch Class}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md16172}
Create a minimatch object by instantiating the {\ttfamily minimatch.\+Minimatch} class.

\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md16173}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Properties}{Properties}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md16173}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily pattern} The original pattern the minimatch object represents.
\item {\ttfamily options} The options supplied to the constructor.
\item {\ttfamily set} A 2-\/dimensional array of regexp or string expressions. Each row in the array corresponds to a brace-\/expanded pattern. Each item in the row corresponds to a single path-\/part. For example, the pattern {\ttfamily \{a,b/c\}/d} would expand to a set of patterns like\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}  [ [ a, d ]
  , [ b, c, d ] ]
\end{DoxyVerb}


If a portion of the pattern doesn\textquotesingle{}t have any "{}magic"{} in it (that is, it\textquotesingle{}s something like {\ttfamily "{}foo"{}} rather than {\ttfamily fo\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}o?}), then it will be left as a string rather than converted to a regular expression.
\item {\ttfamily regexp} Created by the {\ttfamily make\+Re} method. A single regular expression expressing the entire pattern. This is useful in cases where you wish to use the pattern somewhat like {\ttfamily fnmatch(3)} with {\ttfamily FNM\+\_\+\+PATH} enabled.
\item {\ttfamily negate} True if the pattern is negated.
\item {\ttfamily comment} True if the pattern is a comment.
\item {\ttfamily empty} True if the pattern is {\ttfamily "{}"{}}.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md16174}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Methods}{Methods}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md16174}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily make\+Re()} Generate the {\ttfamily regexp} member if necessary, and return it. Will return {\ttfamily false} if the pattern is invalid.
\item {\ttfamily match(fname)} Return true if the filename matches the pattern, or false otherwise.
\item {\ttfamily match\+One(file\+Array, pattern\+Array, partial)} Take a {\ttfamily /}-\/split filename, and match it against a single row in the {\ttfamily reg\+Exp\+Set}. This method is mainly for internal use, but is exposed so that it can be used by a glob-\/walker that needs to avoid excessive filesystem calls.
\item {\ttfamily has\+Magic()} Returns true if the parsed pattern contains any magic characters. Returns false if all comparator parts are string literals. If the {\ttfamily magical\+Braces} option is set on the constructor, then it will consider brace expansions which are not otherwise magical to be magic. If not set, then a pattern like {\ttfamily a\{b,c\}d} will return {\ttfamily false}, because neither {\ttfamily abd} nor {\ttfamily acd} contain any special glob characters.

This does {\bfseries{not}} mean that the pattern string can be used as a literal filename, as it may contain magic glob characters that are escaped. For example, the pattern {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}} or {\ttfamily \mbox{[}\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}\mbox{]}} would not be considered to have magic, as the matching portion parses to the literal string `'{\itshape \textquotesingle{}{\ttfamily and would match a path named}\textquotesingle{}}\textquotesingle{}{\ttfamily , not}\textquotesingle{}\textbackslash{}\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}\textquotesingle{}{\ttfamily or}\textquotesingle{}\mbox{[}\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}\mbox{]}\textquotesingle{}{\ttfamily . The}minimatch.\+unescape()\`{} method may be used to remove escape characters.

Escape all magic characters in a glob pattern, so that it will only ever match literal strings

If the {\ttfamily windows\+Paths\+No\+Escape} option is used, then characters are escaped by wrapping in {\ttfamily \mbox{[}\mbox{]}}, because a magic character wrapped in a character class can only be satisfied by that exact character.

Slashes (and backslashes in {\ttfamily windows\+Paths\+No\+Escape} mode) cannot be escaped or unescaped.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md16178}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{minimatch.\+unescape(pattern, options = \{\})}{minimatch.\+unescape(pattern, options = \{\})}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md16178}
Un-\/escape a glob string that may contain some escaped characters.

If the {\ttfamily windows\+Paths\+No\+Escape} option is used, then square-\/brace escapes are removed, but not backslash escapes. For example, it will turn the string `'\mbox{[}\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}\mbox{]}\textquotesingle{}{\ttfamily into}\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}{\ttfamily , but it will not turn }\textquotesingle{}\textbackslash{}\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}\textquotesingle{}{\ttfamily into}\textquotesingle{}\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}\textquotesingle{}{\ttfamily , because}\`{} is a path separator in {\ttfamily windows\+Paths\+No\+Escape} mode.

When {\ttfamily windows\+Paths\+No\+Escape} is not set, then both brace escapes and backslash escapes are removed.

Slashes (and backslashes in {\ttfamily windows\+Paths\+No\+Escape} mode) cannot be escaped or unescaped.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md16179}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{minimatch.\+match(list, pattern, options)}{minimatch.\+match(list, pattern, options)}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md16179}

Compare a partial path to a pattern. As long as the parts of the path that are present are not contradicted by the pattern, it will be treated as a match. This is useful in applications where you\textquotesingle{}re walking through a folder structure, and don\textquotesingle{}t yet have the full path, but want to ensure that you do not walk down paths that can never be a match.

For example,


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{minimatch('/a/b',\ '/a/*/c/d',\ \{\ partial:\ true\ \})\ //\ true,\ might\ be\ /a/b/c/d}
\DoxyCodeLine{minimatch('/a/b',\ '/**/d',\ \{\ partial:\ true\ \})\ //\ true,\ might\ be\ /a/b/.../d}

Use {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}} as a path separator {\itshape only}, and {\itshape never} as an escape character. If set, all {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}} characters are replaced with {\ttfamily /} in the pattern. Note that this makes it {\bfseries{impossible}} to match against paths containing literal glob pattern characters, but allows matching with patterns constructed using {\ttfamily path.\+join()} and {\ttfamily path.\+resolve()} on Windows platforms, mimicking the (buggy!) behavior of earlier versions on Windows. Please use with caution, and be mindful of the caveat about Windows paths.

For legacy reasons, this is also set if {\ttfamily options.\+allow\+Windows\+Escape} is set to the exact value {\ttfamily false}.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md16197}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{windows\+No\+Magic\+Root}{windows\+No\+Magic\+Root}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md16197}
When a pattern starts with a UNC path or drive letter, and in {\ttfamily nocase\+:true} mode, do not convert the root portions of the pattern into a case-\/insensitive regular expression, and instead leave them as strings.

This is the default when the platform is {\ttfamily win32} and {\ttfamily nocase\+:true} is set.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md16198}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{preserve\+Multiple\+Slashes}{preserve\+Multiple\+Slashes}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md16198}
By default, multiple {\ttfamily /} characters (other than the leading {\ttfamily //} in a UNC path, see "{}\+UNC Paths"{} above) are treated as a single {\ttfamily /}.

That is, a pattern like {\ttfamily a///b} will match the file path {\ttfamily a/b}.

Set {\ttfamily preserve\+Multiple\+Slashes\+: true} to suppress this behavior.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md16199}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{optimization\+Level}{optimization\+Level}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md16199}
A number indicating the level of optimization that should be done to the pattern prior to parsing and using it for matches.

Globstar parts {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}} are always converted to {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}} when {\ttfamily noglobstar} is set, and multiple adjacent {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}} parts are converted into a single {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}} (ie, {\ttfamily a/\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}/\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}/b} will be treated as {\ttfamily a/\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}/b}, as this is equivalent in all cases).


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily 0} -\/ Make no further changes. In this mode, {\ttfamily .} and {\ttfamily ..} are maintained in the pattern, meaning that they must also appear in the same position in the test path string.

  While these optimizations improve the performance of
  file-\/walking use cases such as \href{http://npm.im/glob}{\texttt{ glob}} (ie,
  the reason this module exists), there are cases where it will
  fail to match a literal string that would have been matched in
  optimization level 1 or 0.

  Specifically, while the {\ttfamily Minimatch.match()} method will
  optimize the file path string in the same ways, resulting in
  the same matches, it will fail when tested with the regular
  expression provided by {\ttfamily Minimatch.makeRe()}, unless the path
  string is first processed with

\begin{DoxyPre}If the pattern starts with a {\ttfamily !} character, then it is negated. Set the

{\ttfamily "{}*a?"{}}. This is akin to setting the {\ttfamily nullglob} option in bash, except
that it does not resolve escaped pattern characters.\end{DoxyPre}

\begin{DoxyPre}
\begin{DoxyPre}If brace expansion is not disabled, then it is performed before any
other interpretation of the glob pattern. Thus, a pattern like
{\ttfamily +(a|\{b),c)\}}, which would not be valid in bash or zsh, is expanded
{\bfseries{first}} into the set of {\ttfamily +(a|b)} and {\ttfamily +(a|c)}, and those patterns are
checked for validity. Since those two are valid, matching proceeds.\end{DoxyPre}
\end{DoxyPre}



\begin{DoxyPre}
\begin{DoxyPre}Negated extglob patterns are handled as closely as possible to
Bash semantics, but there are some cases with negative extglobs
which are exceedingly difficult to express in a JavaScript
regular expression. In particular the negated pattern
{\ttfamily <start>!(<pattern>*|)*} will in bash match anything that does
not start with {\ttfamily <start><pattern>}. However,
{\ttfamily <start>!(<pattern>*)*} {\itshape will} match paths starting with
{\ttfamily <start><pattern>}, because the empty string can match against
the negated portion. In this library, {\ttfamily <start>!(<pattern>*|)*}
will {\itshape not} match any pattern starting with {\ttfamily <start>}, due to a
difference in precisely which patterns are considered "{}greedy"{} in
Regular Expressions vs bash path expansion. This may be fixable,
but not without incurring some complexity and performance costs,
and the trade-\/off seems to not be worth pursuing.\end{DoxyPre}
\end{DoxyPre}



\begin{DoxyPre}
\begin{DoxyPre}Note that {\ttfamily fnmatch(3)} in libc is an extremely naive string comparison
matcher, which does not do anything special for slashes. This library is
designed to be used in glob searching and file walkers, and so it does do
special things with {\ttfamily /}. Thus, {\ttfamily foo*} will not match {\ttfamily foo/bar} in this
library, even though it would in {\ttfamily fnmatch(3)}.
