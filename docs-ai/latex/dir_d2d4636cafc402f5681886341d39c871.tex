\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This package provides support for the \href{https://redisbloom.io}{\texttt{ Redis\+Bloom}} module, which adds additional probabilistic data structures to Redis. It extends the \href{https://github.com/redis/node-redis}{\texttt{ Node Redis client}} to include functions for each of the Redi\+Bloom commands.

To use these extra commands, your Redis server must have the Redis\+Bloom module installed.

Redis\+Bloom provides the following probabilistic data structures\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Bloom Filter\+: for checking set membership with a high degree of certainty.
\item Cuckoo Filter\+: for checking set membership with a high degree of certainty.
\item Count-\/\+Min Sketch\+: Determine the frequency of events in a stream.
\item Top-\/K\+: Maintain a list of k most frequently seen items.
\end{DoxyItemize}

For complete examples, see {\ttfamily bloom-\/filter.\+js}, {\ttfamily cuckoo-\/filter.\+js}, {\ttfamily count-\/min-\/sketch.\+js} and {\ttfamily topk.\+js} in the Node Redis examples folder.
