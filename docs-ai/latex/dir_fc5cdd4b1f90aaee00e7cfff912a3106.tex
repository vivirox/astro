\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
\href{https://npmjs.com/package/oniguruma-parser}{\texttt{ }}

Create, traverse, validate, transform, and optimize \href{https://github.com/kkos/oniguruma}{\texttt{ Oniguruma}} regular expressions and ASTs.

This library\textquotesingle{}s core function is {\ttfamily to\+Oniguruma\+Ast}, which returns an Oniguruma AST generated from an Oniguruma pattern.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{function\ toOnigurumaAst(}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ pattern:\ string,}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ options?:\ \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ flags?:\ string;}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ rules?:\ \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ \ \ captureGroup?:\ boolean;}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ \ \ singleline?:\ boolean;}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ \};}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \}}
\DoxyCodeLine{):\ OnigurumaAst;}

\end{DoxyCode}


An error is thrown if the pattern isn\textquotesingle{}t valid in Oniguruma.

This library has been battle-\/tested by \href{https://github.com/slevithan/oniguruma-to-es}{\texttt{ Oniguruma-\/\+To-\/\+ES}}, which is used to transpile tens of thousands of real-\/world Oniguruma regexes.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md25139}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Known differences}{Known differences}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md25139}
Known differences will be resolved in future versions. Contributions are welcome.



{\bfseries{{\bfseries{Unsupported features}}}}\begin{adjustwidth}{1em}{0em}


The following rarely-\/used features throw errors since they aren\textquotesingle{}t yet supported\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Rarely-\/used character specifiers\+: Non-\/\+A-\/\+Za-\/z with {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}cx}, {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}C-\/x}; meta {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}M-\/x}, {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}M-\/\textbackslash{}C-\/x}; bracketed octals {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}o\{…\}}; octal UTF-\/8 encoded bytes (≥ {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}200}).
\item Code point sequences\+: {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}x\{H H …\}}, {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}o\{O O …\}}.
\item Absent expressions {\ttfamily (?\texorpdfstring{$\sim$}{\string~}\texorpdfstring{$\vert$}{|}…\texorpdfstring{$\vert$}{|}…)}, stoppers {\ttfamily (?\texorpdfstring{$\sim$}{\string~}\texorpdfstring{$\vert$}{|}…)}, and clearers {\ttfamily (?\texorpdfstring{$\sim$}{\string~}\texorpdfstring{$\vert$}{|})}.
\item Conditionals\+: {\ttfamily (?(…)…)}, etc.
\item Callouts\+: {\ttfamily (?\{…\})}, {\ttfamily (\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}…)}, etc.
\item Relative forward backreferences {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}k\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}+N\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}} and backrefences with recursion level.
\item Flags {\ttfamily y\{g\}}/{\ttfamily y\{w\}} (grapheme boundary modes); whole-\/pattern modifiers {\ttfamily C} (don\textquotesingle{}t capture group), {\ttfamily I} (ignore-\/case is ASCII), {\ttfamily L} (find longest); flags {\ttfamily D}, {\ttfamily P}, {\ttfamily S}, {\ttfamily W} (digit/\+POSIX/space/word is ASCII) within mode modifiers.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Despite these gaps, more than 99.\+99\% of real-\/world Oniguruma regexes are supported, based on a sample of \texorpdfstring{$\sim$}{\string~}55k regexes used in Text\+Mate grammars (conditionals were used in three regexes, and other unsupported features weren\textquotesingle{}t used at all). Some of the Oniguruma features above are so exotic that they aren\textquotesingle{}t used in {\itshape any} public code on Git\+Hub. \end{adjustwidth}




{\bfseries{{\bfseries{Unsupported errors}}}}\begin{adjustwidth}{1em}{0em}


The following don\textquotesingle{}t yet throw errors, but should\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Special characters that are invalid in backreference names when referencing a valid group with that name.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Named backreferences should use a more restricted set of allowed characters than named groups and subroutines.
\item An error is already thrown for backreference names that include {\ttfamily -\/} or {\ttfamily +}.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Subroutines used in ways that resemble infinite recursion.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Such subroutines error at compile time in Oniguruma. 
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}\end{adjustwidth}




{\bfseries{{\bfseries{Forward backreferences}}}}\begin{adjustwidth}{1em}{0em}


This library currently treats it as an error if numbered backreferences come before their referenced group.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Most such placements are mistakes and can never match, due to Oniguruma\textquotesingle{}s behavior for backreferences to nonparticipating groups.
\item Erroring matches the behavior of named backreferences.
\item For unenclosed backreferences, this affects only {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}1}–{\ttfamily \textbackslash{}9}. It\textquotesingle{}s not a backreference in the first place if using {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}10} or higher and not as many capturing groups are defined to the left (it\textquotesingle{}s an octal or identity escape).
\end{DoxyItemize}

Additionally, this library doesn\textquotesingle{}t yet support the {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}k\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}+N\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}}/`\textbackslash{}k'+N\textquotesingle{}\`{} syntax for relative {\itshape forward} backreferences. \end{adjustwidth}




{\bfseries{{\bfseries{Unenclosed four-\/digit backreferences}}}}\begin{adjustwidth}{1em}{0em}


Although enclosed {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}k\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}…\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}}/`\textbackslash{}k\textquotesingle{}…'{\ttfamily supports any number of digits (assuming the backreference refers to a valid capturing group), unenclosed backreferences currently support only up to three digits (}\textbackslash{}999{\ttfamily ). Oniguruma supports}\textbackslash{}1000{\ttfamily and higher when as many capturing groups are defined, but note that Oniguruma regexes with more than 999 captures never actually work, due to an apparent bug (they fail to match anything, with no error). Tested in Oniguruma 6.\+9.\+8 via}vscode-\/oniguruma\`{}. \end{adjustwidth}


Additional edge case differences will be documented here soon. This library was originally built as part of \href{https://github.com/slevithan/oniguruma-to-es}{\texttt{ Oniguruma-\/\+To-\/\+ES}}, and in that context it made sense to throw in some edge cases that are buggy in Oniguruma. However, as a standalone parser, in most cases the ideal path is to match Oniguruma\textquotesingle{}s intention, even if the pattern would encounter bugs when used to search.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md25140}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{About}{About}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md25140}
