A library to find JS Reg\+Exp with super-\/linear worst-\/case time complexity for attack strings that repeat a single character.

The static analysis method implemented by this library focuses on finding attack string tuples where a single character is repeated. This major limitation allows the library to be fast while also offering decent support for backreferences and \href{https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions/Assertions}{\texttt{ assertions}}.

This library is not intended as a full static analysis to guard against super-\/linear worst-\/case time complexity. It is meant to be as a supplementary analysis on top of existing general analysis methods that don\textquotesingle{}t (or don\textquotesingle{}t fully) support advanced regex features, or as a lightweight analysis on top of existing full (but heavyweight) analysis methods. Libraries that provide such general or near-\/full analysis are known as \href{https://github.com/MakeNowJust-Labo/recheck}{\texttt{ recheck}} and \href{https://github.com/davisjam/vuln-regex-detector}{\texttt{ vuln-\/regex-\/detector}}. You may consider using these libraries as well.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md30298}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Usage}{Usage}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md30298}
This library exports only a single function, {\ttfamily analyse}, which takes a Reg\+Exp literal and returns a list of reports that show the quantifiers causing super-\/linear worst-\/case time complexity.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md30299}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Documentation}{Documentation}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md30299}
For more information on the exact inputs and outputs of each function, see the full API documentation.

\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md30301}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Analysis}{Analysis}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md30301}
This library is implemented using a very limited static analysis method that can only find attack strings where a single character is repeated. Attack strings are generated from a tuple {\itshape (x,y,z)} such that every string \+\_\+s = xy\textsuperscript{n}z\+\_\+ (or {\ttfamily x + y.\+repeat(n) + z} for JS folks) takes \+\_\+O(n\textsuperscript{p})\+\_\+ or \+\_\+O(2\textsuperscript{n})\+\_\+ many steps to reject, p\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}1. This analysis method can only find tuples where {\itshape y} is a single character. E.\+g. the polynomial backtracking in {\ttfamily /\texorpdfstring{$^\wedge$}{\string^}(ab)\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}(ab)\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}\$/} for {\itshape (x,y,z) = ("{}"{}, "{}ab"{}, "{}c"{})} cannot be detected by this library because {\itshape y} is not a single character.

However, this limitation allows the static analysis method to be quick and to provide good (but not perfect) support for backreferences and assertions (e.\+g. {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}b}, {\ttfamily (?\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}!ba+)}).\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md30302}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{False negatives}{False negatives}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md30302}
The analysis method primarily searches for polynomial backtracking. Finds of exponential backtracking are only a byproduct. Because of this, not all causes of super-\/linear worst-\/case time complexity are found.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md30303}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{False positives}{False positives}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md30303}
This library doesn\textquotesingle{}t actually search for the whole tuple {\itshape (x,y,z)}; it only searches for {\itshape y} and assumes that adequate values for {\itshape x} and {\itshape z} can be found. A single-\/character approximation of the suffix {\itshape z} will be computed and accounted for but false positives are still possible.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md30304}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Reports}{Reports}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md30304}
There are 3 different types of reports that each indicate a different type of cause for the super-\/linear worst-\/case time complexity. All are explained in the documentation of their types.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md30305}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Exponential backtracking}{Exponential backtracking}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md30305}
While most reports show polynomial backtracking, some report exponential backtracking. Exponential backtracking is a lot more dangerous and can easily be exploited for \href{https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS}{\texttt{ Re\+DoS attacks}}.

While other reports may be dismissed, {\bfseries{all reports of exponential backtracking must be fixed}}.

All reports with {\ttfamily exponential\+: true} report exponential backtracking.
