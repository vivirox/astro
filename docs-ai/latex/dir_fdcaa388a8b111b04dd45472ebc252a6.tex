\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
A File\+List is a lazy-\/evaluated list of files. When given a list of glob patterns for possible files to be included in the file list, instead of searching the file structures to find the files, a File\+List holds the pattern for latter use.

This allows you to define a File\+List to match any number of files, but only search out the actual files when then File\+List itself is actually used. The key is that the first time an element of the File\+List/\+Array is requested, the pending patterns are resolved into a real list of file names.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md15479}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Usage}{Usage}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md15479}
Add files to the list with the {\ttfamily include} method. You can add glob patterns, individual files, or Reg\+Exp objects. When the Array methods are invoked on the File\+List, these items are resolved to an actual list of files.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{var\ fl\ =\ new\ FileList();}
\DoxyCodeLine{fl.include('test/*.js');}
\DoxyCodeLine{fl.exclude('test/helpers.js');}

\end{DoxyCode}


Use the {\ttfamily exclude} method to override inclusions. You can use this when your inclusions are too broad.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md15480}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Array methods}{Array methods}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md15480}
File\+List has lazy-\/evaluated versions of most of the array methods, including the following\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item join
\item pop
\item push
\item concat
\item reverse
\item shift
\item unshift
\item slice
\item splice
\item sort
\item filter
\item for\+Each
\item some
\item every
\item map
\item index\+Of
\item last\+Index\+Of
\item reduce
\item reduce\+Right
\end{DoxyItemize}

When you call one of these methods, the items in the File\+List will be resolved to the full list of files, and the method will be invoked on that result.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md15481}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Special {\ttfamily length} method}{Special {\ttfamily length} method}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md15481}
{\ttfamily length}\+: File\+List includes a length {\itshape method} (instead of a property) which returns the number of actual files in the list once it\textquotesingle{}s been resolved.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md15482}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{File\+List-\/specific methods}{File\+List-\/specific methods}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md15482}
{\ttfamily include}\+: Add a filename/glob/regex to the list

{\ttfamily exclude}\+: Override inclusions by excluding a filename/glob/regex

{\ttfamily resolve}\+: Resolve the items in the File\+List to the full list of files. This method is invoked automatically when one of the array methods is called.

{\ttfamily to\+Array}\+: Immediately resolves the list of items, and returns an actual array of filepaths.

{\ttfamily clear\+Inclusions}\+: Clears any pending items -- must be used before resolving the list.

{\ttfamily clear\+Exclusions}\+: Clears the list of exclusions rules.
