We are currently working on \href{https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/discussions/3531}{\texttt{ Prism v2}} and will only accept security-\/relevant PRs for the time being.

Once work on Prism v2 is sufficiently advanced, we will accept PRs again. This will be announced on our \href{https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/discussions}{\texttt{ Discussion}} page and mentioned in the \href{https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/discussions/3531}{\texttt{ roadmap discussion}}.



{\bfseries{Prism v1 contributing notes}}\begin{adjustwidth}{1em}{0em}


Prism depends on community contributions to expand and cover a wider array of use cases. If you like it, consider giving back by sending a pull request. Here are a few tips\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Read the \href{https://prismjs.com/extending.html}{\texttt{ documentation}}. Prism was designed to be extensible.
\item Do not edit {\ttfamily prism.\+js}, it’s just the version of Prism used by the Prism website and is built automatically. Limit your changes to the unminified files in the {\ttfamily components/} folder. {\ttfamily prism.\+js} and all minified files are generated by our build system (see below).
\item Use {\ttfamily npm ci} to install Prism\textquotesingle{}s dependencies. Do not use {\ttfamily npm install} because it will cause non-\/deterministic builds.
\item The build system uses \href{https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp}{\texttt{ gulp}} to minify the files and build {\ttfamily prism.\+js}. With all of Prism\textquotesingle{}s dependencies installed, you just need to run the command {\ttfamily npm run build}.
\item Please follow the code conventions used in the files already. For example, I use \href{http://lea.verou.me/2012/01/why-tabs-are-clearly-superior/}{\texttt{ tabs for indentation and spaces for alignment}}. Opening braces are on the same line, closing braces on their own line regardless of construct. There is a space before the opening brace. etc etc.
\item Please try to err towards more smaller PRs rather than a few huge PRs. If a PR includes changes that I want to merge and also changes that I don\textquotesingle{}t, handling it becomes difficult.
\item My time is very limited these days, so it might take a long time to review bigger PRs (small ones are usually merged very quickly), especially those modifying the Prism Core. This doesn\textquotesingle{}t mean your PR is rejected.
\item If you contribute a new language definition, you will be responsible for handling bug reports about that language definition.
\item If you \href{https://prismjs.com/extending.html\#creating-a-new-language-definition}{\texttt{ add a new language definition}} or plugin, you need to add it to {\ttfamily components.\+json} as well and rebuild Prism by running {\ttfamily npm run build}, so that it becomes available to the download build page. For new languages, please also add a few \href{https://prismjs.com/test-suite.html}{\texttt{ tests}} and an example in the {\ttfamily examples/} folder.
\item Go to \href{https://github.com/PrismJS/prism-themes}{\texttt{ prism-\/themes}} if you want to add a new theme.
