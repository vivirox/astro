\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
An implementation of the Unicode Line Breaking Algorithm (UAX \#14)

\begin{quote}
Line breaking, also known as word wrapping, is the process of breaking a section of text into lines such that it will fit in the available width of a page, window or other display area. The Unicode Line Breaking Algorithm performs part of this process. Given an input text, it produces a set of positions called "{}break opportunities"{} that are appropriate points to begin a new line. The selection of actual line break positions from the set of break opportunities is not covered by the Unicode Line Breaking Algorithm, but is in the domain of higher level software with knowledge of the available width and the display size of the text. \end{quote}


This is a Java\+Script implementation of the \href{http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr14/\#SampleCode}{\texttt{ Unicode Line Breaking Algorithm}} for Node.\+js (and browsers I guess). Currently supports Unicode version 13. It is used by \href{http://github.com/devongovett/pdfkit/}{\texttt{ PDFKit}} for line wrapping text in PDF documents, but since the algorithm knows nothing about the actual visual appearance or layout of text, it could be used for other things as well.\hypertarget{readme.md_autotoc_md21604}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Installation}{Installation}}\label{readme.md_autotoc_md21604}
You can install via npm \begin{DoxyVerb}npm install linebreak
\end{DoxyVerb}

In order to use the library, you shouldn\textquotesingle{}t need to know this, but if you\textquotesingle{}re interested in contributing or fixing bugs, these things might be of interest.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The {\ttfamily src/classes.\+js} file is automatically generated from {\ttfamily Line\+Break.\+txt} in the Unicode database by {\ttfamily src/generate\+\_\+data.\+js}. It should be rare that you need to run this, but you may if, for instance, you want to change the Unicode version.
\item You can run the tests using {\ttfamily npm test}. They are written using {\ttfamily mocha}, and generated from {\ttfamily Line\+Break\+Test.\+txt} from the Unicode database, which is included in the repository for performance reasons while running them. About 50 of the over 7600 tests are currently skipped due to implementation differences. It appears that some of the tests may be wrong or use different tailoring from the spec.
