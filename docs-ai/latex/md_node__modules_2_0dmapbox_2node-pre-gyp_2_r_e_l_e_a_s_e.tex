\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Change the version number in {\ttfamily package.\+json}. Run the following command in the package root directory, replacing $<$update\+\_\+type$>$ with one of the semantic versioning release types (prerelease, prepatch, preminor, premajor, patch, minor, major)\+:
\end{DoxyEnumerate}


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{npm\ version\ <update\_type>\ -\/-\/preid\ pre\ -\/-\/no-\/git-\/tag-\/version}

\end{DoxyCode}


{\ttfamily -\/-\/preid} specifies which suffix to use in the release such as {\ttfamily pre}, {\ttfamily next}, {\ttfamily beta}, {\ttfamily rc}, etc.

{\ttfamily prepatch}, {\ttfamily preminor}, and {\ttfamily premajor} start a new series of pre-\/releases while bumping the patch, minor, or major version. E.\+g. {\ttfamily premajor} with {\ttfamily -\/-\/preid pre} would do a prerelease for a new major using the {\ttfamily -\/pre} suffix (i.\+e. it would be a new major with {\ttfamily -\/pre.\+0})

You can use {\ttfamily prerelease} to bump the version for a new pre-\/release version. E.\+g. you could run {\ttfamily npm version prerelease -\/-\/preid pre -\/-\/no-\/git-\/tag-\/version} to go from {\ttfamily -\/pre.\+0} to {\ttfamily -\/pre.\+1}.

For regular versions, you can use {\ttfamily patch}, {\ttfamily minor}, or {\ttfamily major}. E.\+g. {\ttfamily npm version major -\/-\/no-\/git-\/tag-\/version}.


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Update the changelog, which can be found in {\ttfamily CHANGELOG.\+md}. The heading must match {\ttfamily \#\# \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}VERSION\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}} exactly, or it will not be picked up. For example, for version 1.\+0.\+11\+:

\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Commit and push the changes. On push the release workflow will automaticlly check if the release has been published on npm. If the release has not yet been published, the workflow will update the abi crosswalk file and publish a new npm release.
