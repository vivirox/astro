Build tool and bindings loader for \href{https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-gyp}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily node-\/gyp}}} that supports prebuilds. \end{quote}

\href{https://github.com/prebuild/node-gyp-build/actions/workflows/test.yml}{\texttt{ }}

Use together with \href{https://github.com/prebuild/prebuildify}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily prebuildify}}} to easily support prebuilds for your native modules.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md24635}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Usage}{Usage}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md24635}

{\bfseries{Note.}} Prebuild names have changed in \href{https://github.com/prebuild/prebuildify}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily prebuildify@3}}} and {\ttfamily node-\/gyp-\/build@4}. Please see the documentation below. \end{quote}


{\ttfamily node-\/gyp-\/build} works similar to \href{https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-gyp}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily node-\/gyp build}}} except that it will check if a build or prebuild is present before rebuilding your project.

It\textquotesingle{}s main intended use is as an npm install script and bindings loader for native modules that bundle prebuilds using \href{https://github.com/prebuild/prebuildify}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily prebuildify}}}.

First add {\ttfamily node-\/gyp-\/build} as an install script to your native project


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ js}
\DoxyCodeLine{\{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ ...}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ "{}scripts"{}:\ \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ "{}install"{}:\ "{}node-\/gyp-\/build"{}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\}}

\end{DoxyCode}


Then in your {\ttfamily index.\+js}, instead of using the \href{https://www.npmjs.com/package/bindings}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily bindings}}} module use {\ttfamily node-\/gyp-\/build} to load your binding.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ js}
\DoxyCodeLine{var\ binding\ =\ require('node-\/gyp-\/build')(\_\_dirname)}

\end{DoxyCode}


If you do these two things and bundle prebuilds with \href{https://github.com/prebuild/prebuildify}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily prebuildify}}} your native module will work for most platforms without having to compile on install time AND will work in both node and electron without the need to recompile between usage.

Users can override {\ttfamily node-\/gyp-\/build} and force compiling by doing {\ttfamily npm install -\/-\/build-\/from-\/source}.

Prebuilds will be attempted loaded from {\ttfamily MODULE\+\_\+\+PATH/prebuilds/...} and then next {\ttfamily EXEC\+\_\+\+PATH/prebuilds/...} (the latter allowing use with {\ttfamily zeit/pkg})\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md24636}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Supported prebuild names}{Supported prebuild names}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md24636}
If so desired you can bundle more specific flavors, for example {\ttfamily musl} builds to support Alpine, or targeting a numbered ARM architecture version.

These prebuilds can be bundled in addition to generic prebuilds; {\ttfamily node-\/gyp-\/build} will try to find the most specific flavor first. Prebuild filenames are composed of {\itshape tags}. The runtime tag takes precedence, as does an {\ttfamily abi} tag over {\ttfamily napi}. For more details on tags, please see \href{https://github.com/prebuild/prebuildify}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily prebuildify}}}.

Values for the {\ttfamily libc} and {\ttfamily armv} tags are auto-\/detected but can be overridden through the {\ttfamily LIBC} and {\ttfamily ARM\+\_\+\+VERSION} environment variables, respectively.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md24637}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{License}{License}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md24637}
