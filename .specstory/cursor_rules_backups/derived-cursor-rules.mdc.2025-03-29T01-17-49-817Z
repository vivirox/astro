## PROJECT OVERVIEW
Project: Astro

## CODE STYLE
Adhere to standard TypeScript coding conventions.  Avoid using the `any` type unless absolutely necessary and clearly documented. Use `unknown` instead of `any` where appropriate.

## FOLDER ORGANIZATION
Based on the project exploration, the following folders are identified: `src/pages`, `src/layouts`, `src/components`, `src/lib`, `src/config`, `src/constants`, `src/types`, `src/styles`, `src/hooks`, `src/scripts`, `src/data`, `src/workers`, `src/services`, `src/tests`, `src/context`, `src/@types`, `src/db`, `src/docs`, `src/assets`, `src/integrations`, `src/utils`, `src/simulator`, `src/content`.  Further refinement of folder organization may be needed based on project growth.

## TECH STACK
TypeScript, ESLint, Jest, Vitest, Resend, Redis, ioredis, @testing-library/jest-dom, @testing-library/react, @postmark/core, ioredis, @ascorbic/feed-loader, react, react-dom

## PROJECT-SPECIFIC STANDARDS
- Unused variables and imports should be removed.  Address all ESLint warnings about unused code.  If a variable is declared but never used, remove it.  Use the underscore convention for unused parameters (e.g., `_key`).
- Vitest is the preferred testing framework for new tests. Jest should be used for existing tests until migration is complete.  A `vitest.config.ts` file should be created for Vitest configuration, and a Vitest setup file (e.g., `vitest.setup.ts`) is needed to declare Vitest globals for TypeScript projects.  The `jest.config.ts` and associated Jest setup file are deprecated for new tests.
- Proper configuration is required for both Jest (for existing tests) and Vitest (for new tests).  Ensure types are correctly configured for each.
- When mocking external services (like Redis or Resend) in tests, ensure proper type definitions are used to avoid linting errors. Direct access to underlying client methods might be necessary if the service class doesn't expose all required methods.  If direct access is needed, ensure proper mocking of the underlying client (e.g., `ioredis`) is implemented.
- When encountering type errors related to mocked services, consider using type assertions to match the expected type of the mocked function.  However, ensure this is done judiciously and only when necessary to avoid masking actual type problems.
- Ensure proper Jest type configuration for existing tests or migrate to Vitest for new tests.  Address all ESLint warnings about unused code.  If a variable is declared but never used, remove it.  Address all ESLint warnings, including those related to unused variables and imports.  Prioritize resolving critical issues such as redeclaration errors, unsafe optional chaining, undefined variables, and parsing errors before addressing less critical warnings.
- Ensure a `vitest.setup.ts` file exists to provide necessary test globals (e.g., `describe`, `it`, `expect`) for Vitest tests.  Missing test framework globals are a common source of errors.
- When encountering missing test framework globals (describe, it, expect, etc.) in Vitest tests, ensure that the `vitest.setup.ts` file is correctly configured and includes the necessary imports.  Commonly missing imports include `describe`, `it`, `expect`, `beforeAll`, `beforeEach`, `afterEach`, and `afterAll`.  The `vitest.setup.ts` file should also include a `declare global` block to make these globals available in test files.
- When importing modules, carefully check the export type (class vs. constant) to avoid import errors.  Correctly import modules based on their export type (e.g., `import { CacheInvalidation } from '@/lib/cache/invalidation'` instead of `import { CacheInvalidationService } from '@/lib/cache/invalidation'`).  Ensure that the import path correctly reflects the module's location.  Ensure that all necessary modules are imported, especially those from appropriate locations (e.g.,  `'@/lib/ai/services/PatternRecognitionService'`, `'@/lib/ai/services/PatternRecognitionService'`).
- When using `CacheInvalidation`, ensure that the `redis` property is passed as `{ redis: redis.getClient() }` to correctly access the Redis client.  The `initialize()` and `shutdown()` methods are not part of the `CacheInvalidation` interface and should not be used.  Use `JSON.stringify` for serializing values before storing them in Redis.  The `addTag` method is deprecated; use the `set()` method with the `tags` option to add tags to keys.  The `on` and `off` methods for event handling are not supported by `CacheInvalidation`. Direct verification of key existence should be used instead of event listeners.
- Ensure that the `vitest.setup.ts` file includes imports for `describe`, `it`, `expect`, `beforeAll`, `beforeEach`, `afterEach`, and `afterAll`, and a `declare global` block to make these globals available in test files.  Failure to include these can lead to missing test framework globals errors.  Correct import paths are crucial to avoid module import errors.  When updating tests to align with new service implementations, ensure that methods, parameters, and return types are correctly updated to match the current version.
- When encountering missing module imports, carefully check the module's location.  Incorrect import paths are a frequent source of errors.  For example, ensure that `'@/lib/ai/services/PatternRecognitionService'` is used correctly.
- Ensure proper type definitions for all RedisService methods and parameters.  Missing types are a common source of errors in Redis service integration tests.  Include necessary utility functions (e.g., `generateTestKey`, `sleep`) and custom matchers (e.g., `toBeRedisError`) for more robust testing.
- In Redis service integration tests, ensure proper type definitions for all methods and parameters. Import necessary utility functions (e.g., `generateTestKey`, `sleep`) from `test-utils` and add custom matchers (e.g., `toBeRedisError`) for more robust testing.  Ensure that `generateTestKey` and other necessary utility functions from `./test-utils` are imported into test files where needed.
- When encountering "is declared but its value is never read" errors, remove unused imports or use the underscore convention for unused parameters (e.g., `_key`).
- When using the `RedisService.set` method, ensure that TTL values are provided in milliseconds.  The method signature is `async set(key: string, value: string, ttlMs?: number): Promise<void>`.
- When using the `RedisService.set` method, ensure TTL values are provided in milliseconds. The method signature is `async set(key: string, value: string, ttlMs?: number): Promise<void>`.  Incorrectly providing TTL in seconds will result in a type error.  The correct usage is `await redis.set(key, value, ttl * 1000);` where `ttl` is in seconds.
- When using JSON.stringify, ensure the resulting string is of the correct type for Redis storage (e.g., string).
- To resolve the error "Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'globalTeardown' does not exist in type 'InlineConfig'", use a `vitest.global.setup.ts` file exporting both `setup` and `teardown` functions instead of separate `globalSetup` and `globalTeardown` properties in the Vitest configuration.
- For custom matchers in Vitest, use the `declare global` syntax as shown in the updated `test-utils.ts` example below.  This ensures correct type definitions and avoids linting errors.
- When encountering file not found errors, double-check the file path.  The error "Could not find file 'src/lib/services/redis.ts'. Did you mean one of: - src/lib/services/redis/index.ts - src/lib/services/redis/types.ts - src/lib/services/redis/RedisService.ts" indicates a potential issue with the file path or file organization.  Ensure the correct path is used and that the file exists in the specified location.  Correct import paths are crucial for resolving modules.  Ensure that the `tsconfig.json` file is correctly configured with `baseUrl` and `paths` to resolve relative imports correctly (e.g., `@/lib/redis`).  When encountering errors related to missing modules, double-check the import path. For example, ensure that `'@/lib/ai/services/PatternRecognitionService'` is used correctly.
- When using the logger, ensure proper instantiation, for example using `const logger = loggerModule.getLogger('NotificationService')`.
- Ensure proper closing tags for MDX `<Steps>` components.  Incorrect indentation can cause parsing errors.
- Ensure correct indentation for closing `</Steps>` tags in MDX files to avoid parsing errors.  Malformatted code blocks and duplicate lines in MDX files can also cause build errors.
- When encountering "Cannot find module '@/config/env.config'" errors, verify the `baseUrl` and `paths` configuration within `tsconfig.json` to ensure correct resolution of relative imports correctly.
- Avoid using JSX directly within TypeScript files.  Use `React.createElement` instead for better compatibility and type safety.  This is particularly important when working with Astro components.  The error "Unexpected token '<'" usually indicates this issue.  Ensure that all React imports are correctly handled.  For example, instead of `return <>{children}</>;`, use `return React.createElement(React.Fragment, null, children);`.  Avoid duplicate exports within the same file.  If multiple functions or variables share the same name, rename one of them to avoid naming conflicts.
- When encountering issues with React module resolution, ensure that Astro is correctly configured to handle React imports using either the `react` or `@astrojs/react` package.  Ensure that the necessary React packages are installed and configured correctly.
- When using JSX within Astro components, ensure that the necessary React packages are installed (`react`, `react-dom`) and that the component is correctly configured for JSX usage.  Incorrect configuration can result in runtime errors.  Ensure that the `astro.config.mjs` file is correctly configured to handle React imports.  Refer to the Astro documentation for guidance on configuring JSX within Astro projects.  Use of `use client` directive in Astro components helps ensure proper hydration and prevents issues.
- Avoid using JSX directly within TypeScript files unless explicitly using `.tsx` file extension and configured correctly with `tsconfig.json` to handle JSX.  The error "Unexpected token '<'" usually indicates this issue.  Ensure that all React imports are correctly handled.  For example, instead of `return <>{children}</>;`, use `return React.createElement(React.Fragment, null, children);`.  Avoid duplicate exports within the same file.  If multiple functions or variables share the same name, rename one of them to avoid naming conflicts.

## PROJECT DOCUMENTATION & CONTEXT SYSTEM
(No information provided in the interaction)

## DEBUGGING
Utilize ESLint to identify and resolve TypeScript linting issues, including unused variables, type issues, and testing framework configuration problems. Address warnings and errors promptly.  If using Vitest, ensure it's correctly configured and integrated. Address all ESLint warnings, including those related to unused variables and imports. Prioritize resolving critical issues such as redeclaration errors, unsafe optional chaining, undefined variables, and parsing errors before addressing less critical warnings. Ensure proper Jest type configuration for existing tests or migrate to Vitest for new tests.  Prioritize resolving critical ESLint errors (redeclaration, unsafe optional chaining, undefined variables, parsing errors) before addressing warnings.  When encountering import errors, carefully check the export type of the imported module (e.g., class vs. constant).  For mocked services, ensure proper typing to avoid errors. When mocking Redis, consider mocking `ioredis` directly if necessary to access all required methods. When using type assertions in tests to resolve type errors, ensure this is a deliberate choice and not a way to mask underlying type issues.  When encountering errors related to undefined variables in tests, ensure that the testing framework (Jest or Vitest) is correctly configured and that necessary types are imported.  If using Vitest, ensure proper configuration and integration, including the presence and correct configuration of `vitest.setup.ts`. If using Jest, ensure types are properly configured.  Check for missing test framework globals (describe, it, expect, etc.) when using Vitest. Ensure necessary modules are imported in test files, including those from appropriate locations (e.g., `'@/lib/ai/services/PatternRecognitionService'`). Address implicit any types in parameters.  When debugging tests, ensure that the `vitest.setup.ts` file (for Vitest) or the equivalent Jest setup file is correctly configured and includes the necessary imports for test globals (e.g., `describe`, `it`, `expect`).  Pay close attention to import statements; ensure they correctly reflect the export type of the module (class vs. function/constant).  When working with `CacheInvalidation`, ensure you are using the correct import (`import { CacheInvalidation } from '@/lib/cache/invalidation'`), passing the redis client correctly (`{ redis: redis.getClient() }`), and using `JSON.stringify` for values.  The `addTag` method is deprecated; use the `set()` method with the `tags` option instead. The `on` and `off` methods for event handling are not supported by `CacheInvalidation`. Direct verification of key existence should be used instead of event listeners.  When resolving missing module import errors, ensure that the import path correctly reflects the module's location.  Incorrect import paths are a frequent source of errors.  When updating tests to match new service implementations, update method names, parameters, and return types accordingly.  Ensure that all necessary test globals (`describe`, `it`, `expect`, etc.) are imported in test files, and that the `vitest.setup.ts` file is correctly configured and includes the necessary imports.  Commonly missing imports include `describe`, `it`, `expect`, `beforeAll`, `beforeEach`, `afterEach`, and `afterAll`.  The `vitest.setup.ts` file should also include a `declare global` block to make these globals available in test files.  When encountering "is declared but its value is never read" errors, remove unused imports. When encountering "is declared but its value is never read" errors for parameters, use the underscore convention for unused parameters (e.g., `_key`).  When debugging Redis service integration tests, ensure that all necessary types and interfaces are imported from the correct locations.  Import utility functions from `test-utils` and add custom matchers for more robust testing. When dealing with TTL in Redis operations, remember that the `RedisService.set` method expects TTL in milliseconds, not seconds.  When using `JSON.stringify`, ensure that the resulting string is of the correct type for Redis storage (e.g., string).  For ESLint errors related to namespaces in Jest test files, consider migrating to Vitest or using `// @ts-expect-error` comments judiciously to suppress errors related to custom matchers until a full migration can be completed. This is a temporary solution to allow for a phased migration.  Double-check file paths for accuracy. Incorrect paths are a frequent source of errors. Ensure proper logger instantiation, for example using `const logger = loggerModule.getLogger('NotificationService')`. When encountering "Cannot find module '@/config/env.config'" errors, ensure that the `tsconfig.json` file is correctly configured with `baseUrl` and `paths` to resolve relative imports correctly.  When using the `@ascorbic/feed-loader`, consider adding more robust error handling and potentially a fallback mechanism to handle connectivity issues.  Consider adding `retries`, `retryDelay`, `fallback`, `cacheMaxAge`, and `skipOnFail` options to handle potential failures gracefully. Ensure proper closing tags for MDX `<Steps>` components. Incorrect indentation can cause parsing errors.  Correctly handle code blocks within MDX files to avoid parsing errors. Review files in `src/pages` directory, specifically `index.astro`, for homepage issues. Review `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro` and `src/layouts/StandardLayout.astro` for layout related problems. Investigate `src/components/widgets/SpinningGlobe.astro` for component-specific issues.  Malformatted code blocks and duplicate lines in MDX files (like `src/content/docs/redis-testing.mdx`) can cause build errors and affect the homepage.  Check for malformed code blocks and duplicate lines in MDX files. Review `src/simulator/index.ts` for JSX usage within TypeScript. Use `React.createElement` instead.  Check for duplicate exports in `src/simulator/utils/privacy.ts`. Rename duplicate exports to resolve conflicts.  Ensure that `astro.config.mjs` is correctly configured to handle React imports.  Address "module is not defined" errors by configuring Astro to handle React imports correctly, potentially using a custom Vite configuration or a custom React loader. The error typically indicates a mismatch between the module system used by React and the project's module system.  Ensure that the correct version of React is installed and that the necessary dependencies are included.  Use the `use client` directive in Astro components to ensure proper React hydration.
