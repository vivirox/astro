I apologize, but I need more information about what you'd like me to help you with. Your query "ix" is too brief for me to understand your intent. 

Looking at the attached files, I can see there are some TypeScript ESLint warnings in a WebSocket server test file, but I'm not sure if that's what you'd like to address.

Could you please:
1. Clarify what you'd like me to help you with
2. Provide more context about what you're trying to accomplish

This will help me give you the most relevant and helpful response.
