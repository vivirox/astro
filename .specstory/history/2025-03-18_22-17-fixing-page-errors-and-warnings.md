# Fixing Page Errors and Warnings (2025-03-18 18:17:17)

_**User**_

Fix all the errors and warnings on this page

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help analyze and fix any errors or warnings in the encryption documentation. Let me first read through the file carefully.

---

Read file: src/docs/security/encryption.mdx

---

I've identified several issues in the MDX documentation that need to be fixed. I'll make the necessary corrections:

1. Code block formatting issues
2. Inconsistent spacing in Accordion components
3. Extra backticks in CodeGroup sections
4. Typo in company name in description
5. Unnecessary empty line with `{" "}`
6. Inconsistent code indentation

Let me fix these issues:

I've made several improvements to the MDX file:

1. Fixed the typo in the description: "Gradiants" → "Gradiant's"
2. Fixed code block formatting by:
   - Removing extra backticks (`````)
   - Properly indenting code blocks
   - Fixing spacing in code examples
3. Improved Accordion content formatting by:
   - Converting single-line lists to proper multi-line lists
   - Removing unnecessary line breaks
   - Fixing indentation
4. Removed unnecessary `{" "}` spacer
5. Fixed CodeGroup component formatting
6. Standardized indentation throughout the file

The documentation should now be properly formatted and free of errors. The changes maintain the same content while improving readability and fixing MDX syntax issues. All components should now render correctly, and the code examples are properly formatted with consistent indentation.

Would you like me to verify any specific section or make additional improvements to the documentation?

I've made several improvements to fix the markdown formatting issues:

1. Fixed code block syntax:
   - Removed extra backticks (`````)
   - Properly closed code blocks
   - Fixed indentation in code examples

2. Improved list formatting:
   - Changed dash (-) lists to asterisk (*) lists for better MDX compatibility
   - Fixed line breaks in lists
   - Properly indented list items
   - Converted single-line lists to proper multi-line lists

3. Fixed component spacing:
   - Removed unnecessary blank lines between components
   - Added consistent spacing around components
   - Fixed indentation of nested components

4. Improved Accordion content:
   - Fixed list formatting inside Accordions
   - Properly formatted multi-line content
   - Consistent indentation

5. Fixed CodeGroup formatting:
   - Proper spacing between code blocks
   - Consistent code block syntax
   - Fixed language identifiers

The documentation should now be properly formatted and free of markdown warnings. The changes maintain the same content while improving readability and ensuring proper MDX syntax. All components should render correctly with consistent spacing and formatting.

Would you like me to verify any specific section or make additional improvements to the documentation?

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Expected a closing tag for `<Frame>` (12:1-12:8)
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

---

_**Assistant**_

I see the issue. The `<Frame>` component in the authentication.mdx file is not properly closed. Let me fix that:

---

```diff
  
  <Frame>
-   ```mermaid sequenceDiagram participant User participant Client participant API
-   participant Supabase User->>Client: Enter Credentials Client->>Supabase: Sign
-   In Request Supabase-->>Client: JWT Token Client->>API: API Request + Token
-   API->>Supabase: Verify Token Supabase-->>API: Token Valid API-->>Client:
-   Response Client-->>User: Update UI ```
+   ```mermaid
+   sequenceDiagram
+     participant User
+     participant Client
+     participant API
+     participant Supabase
+     User->>Client: Enter Credentials
+     Client->>Supabase: Sign In Request
+     Supabase-->>Client: JWT Token
+     Client->>API: API Request + Token
+     API->>Supabase: Verify Token
+     Supabase-->>API: Token Valid
+     API-->>Client: Response
+     Client-->>User: Update UI
+   ```
  </Frame>
  
```

---

I've fixed the issue by:
1. Properly formatting the mermaid diagram with correct line breaks and indentation
2. Ensuring the `<Frame>` component is properly closed
3. Fixed the mermaid syntax to be valid

The error should now be resolved. The diagram will render correctly within the Frame component.

Add mdx to trunk's markdownlint ignore

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you add MDX files to trunk's markdownlint ignore configuration. Let me check for the trunk configuration file first.

---

<details>
            <summary>Searched codebase "trunk.yaml" • **1** results</summary>
        
| File |
|------|
| `undefined` |

</details>

---

Read file: .trunk/trunk.yaml

---

Let me add MDX files to the markdownlint ignore configuration:

---

```diff
        paths:
          - .env.local
+     - linters: [markdownlint]
+       paths:
+         - "**/*.mdx"
  actions:
    enabled:
```

---

I've added a new ignore rule to the trunk configuration that will:
1. Ignore markdownlint for all `.mdx` files in any directory
2. Keep the existing ignore rules intact
3. Use the glob pattern `**/*.mdx` to match all MDX files recursively

The markdownlint warnings for MDX files should now be suppressed. Would you like me to verify this change or help with anything else?
