# TypeScript Argument Type Error Resolution (2025-03-28 06:58:35)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Argument of type '{ EX: number; }' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

_**Assistant**_

I need to check the RedisService implementation to understand the correct interface for the `set` method.

Let me check the interface for the Redis client to understand what options it supports.

Now I understand the issue. Let me implement the fix.

---

```diff
        const ttl = 2
  
-       await redis.set(key, value, { EX: ttl })
+       await redis.set(key, value, "EX", ttl)
        await expect(key).toHaveTTL(ttl)
  
```

---

I see we have a new error. Let me check the implementation of the `set` method in the `RedisService` to understand the signature better.

---

Read file: src/lib/services/redis/RedisService.ts

---

Now I understand the issue completely. The `RedisService.set` method signature is:

```typescript
async set(key: string, value: string, ttlMs?: number): Promise<void>
```

Let me fix the test to convert seconds to milliseconds (since the method expects milliseconds):

---

```diff
        const ttl = 2
  
-       await redis.set(key, value, "EX", ttl)
+       await redis.set(key, value, ttl * 1000)
        await expect(key).toHaveTTL(ttl)
  
```

---

The TypeScript linter error should now be fixed. The issue was caused by a mismatch between the test's use of the Redis service and the actual implementation. 

While the Redis protocol itself uses commands like `SET key value EX seconds`, the `RedisService` wrapper in this codebase has simplified the API to accept TTL in milliseconds as a third parameter.

The fix converts the TTL value from seconds to milliseconds (ttl * 1000) to match the expected interface of the RedisService implementation.
