# Linter Error Troubleshooting (2025-03-27 17:59:18)

whats wrong with this run

_**Assistant**_

Let me analyze the error output from the Trunk CLI run.

The main error message indicates:
```
"Precondition failure: result.paths.size() == 1 (trunk/cli/lint/linters/rewrite_linter.cc:60)"
```

This appears to be happening while ESLint is trying to fix multiple files:
- `src/components/ui/Button.tsx`
- `src/components/ui/Input.tsx` 
- `src/components/ui/Label.tsx`

The error suggests there's an issue with Trunk's linter execution, specifically in its rewrite linter component. The precondition failure indicates that the linter expected to process one file path but received multiple files instead.

Let me check if there are any known issues or solutions for this.

Based on the error and my experience with similar issues, here are a few potential solutions:

1. Run the linting fixes one file at a time instead of all three at once:
```bash
trunk check --fix src/components/ui/Button.tsx
trunk check --fix src/components/ui/Input.tsx
trunk check --fix src/components/ui/Label.tsx
```

2. Update your Trunk CLI version (you're currently on 1.22.11). Let me check for the latest version:

Based on my research and the error output, here are the recommended solutions:

1. **Update Trunk CLI**: You're currently on version 1.22.11, but there have been several updates since then. The latest version includes various fixes and improvements. You can update using:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.trunk.io | bash
```

2. **Run Fixes Individually**: Instead of trying to fix multiple files at once, run the fixes one at a time:
```bash
trunk check --fix src/components/ui/Button.tsx
trunk check --fix src/components/ui/Input.tsx
trunk check --fix src/components/ui/Label.tsx
```

3. **Check Configuration**: Ensure your `.trunk/trunk.yaml` configuration is properly set up for your project. The error suggests there might be an issue with the rewrite linter configuration.

4. **Clear Trunk Cache**: Sometimes clearing the Trunk cache can help resolve issues:
```bash
trunk cache clean
```

I recommend trying these solutions in this order:
1. First, update your Trunk CLI to the latest version
2. If the issue persists, try running the fixes individually
3. If you're still having problems, we can look at your Trunk configuration file

Would you like me to help you try any of these solutions?
