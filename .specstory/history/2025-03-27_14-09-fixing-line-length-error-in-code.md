# Fixing Line Length Error in Code (2025-03-27 10:09:44)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Line length (Trunk)
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me help you fix the line length issue. This error typically occurs when a line exceeds the maximum allowed length (usually 80-120 characters) according to code style guidelines.

Let me search for relevant code to identify the specific lines causing the issue.

Based on the search results, I can see that there are line length configuration files in the project. Let me check the specific configuration to help resolve the line length error.

The project has multiple line length configurations:
1. `.editorconfig`: max_line_length = 100
2. `.trunk/configs/.yamllint.yaml`: line-length max = 120
3. `.trunk/configs/.markdownlint.yaml`: line_length = 120

Looking at the error message "Line length (Trunk)", this indicates that Trunk is enforcing line length limits. The configuration in `.trunk/configs/.yamllint.yaml` shows that the maximum line length is set to 120 characters.

Let me search for the specific line that's causing the issue.

I can see several lines that exceed the 120-character limit. Let me help you fix this by editing the problematic lines in the project overview file.

I've split the long lines in the project overview file into multiple lines while maintaining readability. Each line is now under 120 characters, which should resolve the Trunk line length error.

The changes:
1. Split the project overview description into three lines
2. Split the core mission statement into three lines

This maintains the content while adhering to the line length limit of 120 characters specified in the Trunk configuration. The text is still easily readable and properly formatted in Markdown.

Is there anything else you'd like me to help you with?

For the code present, we get this error:
```
The `Function` type accepts any function-like value.
Prefer explicitly defining any function parameters and return type.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you fix the TypeScript linter error by properly typing the event handlers.

---

```diff
  ```typescript
  interface Events {
-   on: (event: string, handler: Function) => void
-   off: (event: string, handler: Function) => void
+   on: (event: string, handler: (data: unknown) => void) => void
+   off: (event: string, handler: (data: unknown) => void) => void
    emit: (event: string, data: any) => void
-   once: (event: string, handler: Function) => void
+   once: (event: string, handler: (data: unknown) => void) => void
  }
  ```
```

---

I've replaced the generic `Function` type with properly typed event handler functions. The changes:

1. Changed `handler: Function` to `handler: (data: unknown) => void` for all event handlers
2. Used `unknown` for the data parameter since events can emit different types of data
3. Kept the return type as `void` since event handlers typically don't return values

This provides better type safety while maintaining flexibility for different event types. The linter error should now be resolved.
