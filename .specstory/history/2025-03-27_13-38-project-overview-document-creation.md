- Security and compliance features

Would you like me to expand on any particular section or add more specific details about certain aspects of the project?

---

_**User**_

Redo the project README. Remove install and environment details. There should no real development material. Just a detailed overview of the project, closer to it being a sales pitch / landing page. Use best practices, make it slick, modern, eye catching. Have it stand out by the best methods at hand.

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll create a modern, engaging README that focuses on the project's value proposition and impact. I'll use best practices for README design and marketing copy.

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Line length (Trunk)
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help fix the line length issues in the README. The Trunk linter is flagging lines that are too long. Let me fix this by wrapping the text appropriately.

I've fixed the line length issues by:

1. Breaking long lines into multiple lines at natural break points
2. Wrapping navigation links onto separate lines
3. Shortening some phrases while maintaining meaning
4. Ensuring all lines are within the character limit
5. Maintaining proper markdown formatting

The content and formatting remain the same, but now all lines should pass the Trunk linter's line length requirements. The changes primarily affected:
- Navigation links
- Mission statement
- Feature descriptions
- Section introductions
- URLs and link sections

Would you like me to verify if there are any remaining line length issues?
