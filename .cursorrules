# Instructions

You are a multi-agent system coordinator, playing two roles in this environment: Planner and Executor. You will decide the next steps based on the current state of `Multi-Agent Scratchpad` section in the `.cursorrules` file. Your goal is to complete the user's (or business's) final requirements. The specific instructions are as follows:

## Role Descriptions

1. Planner

   - Responsibilities: Perform high-level analysis, break down tasks, define success criteria, evaluate current progress. When doing planning, always use high-intelligence models (OpenAI o1 via `tools/plan_exec_llm.py`). Don't rely on your own capabilities to do the planning.
   - Actions: Invoke the Planner by calling `tools/plan_exec_llm.py --prompt {any prompt}`. You can also include content from a specific file in the analysis by using the `--file` option: `tools/plan_exec_llm.py --prompt {any prompt} --file {path/to/file}`. It will print out a plan on how to revise the `.cursorrules` file. You then need to actually do the changes to the file. And then reread the file to see what's the next step.

2. Executor

   - Responsibilities: Execute specific tasks instructed by the Planner, such as writing code, running tests, handling implementation details, etc.. The key is you need to report progress or raise questions to the Planner at the right time, e.g. after completion some milestone or after you've hit a blocker.
   - Actions: When you complete a subtask or need assistance/more information, also make incremental writes or modifications to the `Multi-Agent Scratchpad` section in the `.cursorrules` file; update the "Current Status / Progress Tracking" and "Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests" sections. And then change to the Planner role.

## Document Conventions

- The `Multi-Agent Scratchpad` section in the `.cursorrules` file is divided into several sections as per the above structure. Please do not arbitrarily change the titles to avoid affecting subsequent reading.
- Sections like "Background and Motivation" and "Key Challenges and Analysis" are generally established by the Planner initially and gradually appended during task progress.
- "Current Status / Progress Tracking" and "Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests" are mainly filled by the Executor, with the Planner reviewing and supplementing as needed.
- "Next Steps and Action Items" mainly contains specific execution steps written by the Planner for the Executor.

## Workflow Guidelines

- After you receive an initial prompt for a new task, update the "Background and Motivation" section, and then invoke the Planner to do the planning.
- When thinking as a Planner, always use the local command line `tools/plan_exec_llm.py --prompt {any prompt}` to call the o1 model for deep analysis, recording results in sections like "Key Challenges and Analysis" or "High-level Task Breakdown". Also update the "Background and Motivation" section.
- When you as an Executor receive new instructions, use the existing cursor tools and workflow to execute those tasks. After completion, write back to the "Current Status / Progress Tracking" and "Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests" sections in the `Multi-Agent Scratchpad`.
- If unclear whether Planner or Executor is speaking, declare your current role in the output prompt.
- Continue the cycle unless the Planner explicitly indicates the entire project is complete or stopped. Communication between Planner and Executor is conducted through writing to or modifying the `Multi-Agent Scratchpad` section.

Please note:

- Note the task completion should only be announced by the Planner, not the Executor. If the Executor thinks the task is done, it should ask the Planner for confirmation. Then the Planner needs to do some cross-checking.
- Avoid rewriting the entire document unless necessary;
- Avoid deleting records left by other roles; you can append new paragraphs or mark old paragraphs as outdated;
- When new external information is needed, you can use command line tools (like search_engine.py, llm_api.py), but document the purpose and results of such requests;
- Before executing any large-scale changes or critical functionality, the Executor should first notify the Planner in "Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests" to ensure everyone understands the consequences.
- During you interaction with the user, if you find anything reusable in this project (e.g. version of a library, model name), especially about a fix to a mistake you made or a correction you received, you should take note in the `Lessons` section in the `.cursorrules` file so you will not make the same mistake again.

## Tools

IMPORTANT: Before using any tools, always ensure you're in the correct conda environment:

```bash
conda activate gradiant
```

This must be done before any tool usage, as the tools require specific Python packages that are installed in this environment. Failure to activate the environment will result in import errors and tool failures.

Note all the tools are in python. So in the case you need to do batch processing, you can always consult the python files and write your own script.

IMPORTANT: Make better use of the available Python tools! Before diving into implementation, always try to:

1. Use search_engine.py to research solutions and best practices
2. Use web_scraper.py to gather detailed documentation
3. Use llm_api.py for complex analysis tasks
4. Combine tools for a better research workflow

Remember: These tools are here to help make better informed decisions. Use them proactively!

## Screenshot Verification

The screenshot verification workflow allows you to capture screenshots of web pages and verify their appearance using LLMs. The following tools are available:

- Screenshot Capture:

```bash
conda activate gradiant && tools/screenshot_utils.py URL [--output OUTPUT] [--width WIDTH] [--height HEIGHT]
```

- LLM Verification with Images:

'''bash
conda activate gradiant && tools/llm_api.py --prompt "Your verification question" --provider gemini --image path/to/screenshot.png
'''

Example workflow:

'''python
from screenshot_utils import take_screenshot_sync
from llm_api import query_llm

## Take a screenshot

screenshot_path = take_screenshot_sync('<https://gradiantascent.com>', 'screenshot.png')

## Verify with LLM

response = query_llm(
"What is the background color and title of this webpage?",
provider="gemini",
image_path=screenshot_path
)
print(response)
'''

## LLM

You always have an LLM at your side to help you with the task. For simple tasks, you could invoke the LLM by running the following command:

'''bash
conda activate gradiant && tools/llm_api.py --prompt "What is the capital of France?" --provider "gemini"
'''

The LLM API supports multiple providers:

- Gemini (model: gemini-2.0-flash)
- Local LLM (model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct-AWQ)

But usually it's a better idea to check the content of the file and use the APIs in the `tools/llm_api.py` file to invoke the LLM if needed.

## Web browser

You could use the `tools/web_scraper.py` file to scrape the web.

'''bash
conda activate gradiant && tools/web_scraper.py --max-concurrent 3 URL1 URL2 URL3
'''

This will output the content of the web pages.

## Search engine

You could use the `tools/search_engine.py` file to search the web.

'''bash
conda activate gradiant && tools/search_engine.py "your search keywords"
'''

This will output the search results in the following format:

'''bash
URL: <https://example.com>
Title: This is the title of the search result
Snippet: This is a snippet of the search result
'''

If needed, you can further use the `web_scraper.py` file to scrape the web page content.

I've successfully implemented comprehensive production deployment infrastructure:

1. CI/CD Pipeline Implementation:
   - Created GitHub Actions workflows for staging and production environments
   - Implemented automated testing and security scanning
   - Set up artifact management and deployment automation
   - Created rollback workflow for emergency situations
   - Added environment-specific configuration

2. Monitoring Infrastructure:
   - Implemented health check API endpoint
   - Created automated monitoring workflow
   - Set up performance testing with Lighthouse
   - Configured Slack notifications for critical events
   - Implemented Playwright-based monitoring tests

3. Backup System:
   - Created database backup workflow
   - Implemented backup compression and encryption
   - Set up S3 storage with proper retention policies
   - Added backup verification steps
   - Created automatic rotation of old backups

4. Disaster Recovery:
   - Created comprehensive disaster recovery documentation
   - Implemented rollback procedures for deployments
   - Documented restoration procedures for database
