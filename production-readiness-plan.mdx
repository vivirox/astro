# Production Readiness Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive plan to get our Astro application fully production-ready.
With the Astro conversion complete, we now need to focus on addressing remaining issues, performance
optimizations, security hardening, and operational excellence to ensure a smooth launch.

## Progress Status: Final Preparations (85% Ready)

We've completed the major developmental work with our Astro conversion (100% complete).
Now we need to address specific production-critical items and implement operational best practices
for a successful launch.
